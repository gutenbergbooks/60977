<span>SNUG DOWN</span></h2>


<p class="noi">TWILIGHT was creeping up Old Baldy Mountain
as the dusty station wagon turned in at the private
road leading to Pine Cone Girl Scout Camp.</p>

<p>In the front seat beside the driver, Miss Louise
Ward, troop leader, twisted sideways to smile at the
six girls who rode directly behind. All were attired
in the neat, green uniform of the organization, but
each member of Beaver Patrol, it seemed, wore her
dark green beret at a different angle.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be there now, girls,” the troop leader
remarked. “Pine Cone is lovely. We should have a
grand vacation.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s too late for a swim this afternoon,”
remarked Judy Grant. She was one of the newest
members of the patrol, a pleasant, dark-haired girl
with saucy brown eyes and a ready wit.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that by the time we’re snug down in
our tents, it will be supper time,” the teacher replied,
looking at her wrist watch. “Besides, we’re all rather
tired after driving from Fairfield.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready for chow whenever it comes,”
declared plump, good-natured Ardeth Padgett. “This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
invigorating pine air has given me a tremendous appetite.”</p>

<p>“Given it to you?” teased Beverly Chester. “I’d
say you always had it!”</p>

<p>The remark was made and accepted in fun.
Nevertheless, Beverly had a quick tongue which
occasionally annoyed even her best friends. At one time, the
dark-haired eighth grader had been leader of the
patrol. However, during the previous winter, an
unfortunate skiing incident had caused her to become
conscious of her personality handicap, and she had
insisted upon turning the post over to Kathleen Atwell.</p>

<p>Kathleen was considered one of the most level-headed
girls in the organization. A natural leader,
she always was thoughtful of others and had a way
of getting things done with a minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>The other patrol members were Betty Bache, who
wore her sandy hair in a short boyish bob, and Virginia
Cunningham, an excellent athlete. Judy had
nicknamed the three girls the “A-B-C’s” because of
their last names&mdash;Atwell&mdash;Bache&mdash;Cunningham.</p>

<p>All the girls lived in the little city of Fairfield,
some distance from Old Baldy Mountain. Throughout
Spring, they had worked very hard to save
enough money for an outing at the official Girl Scout
Camp on Morning Glory Lake. Now, as the station
wagon turned into the private road, they felt that
they were indeed at the threshold of a wonderful
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
“Our arrival here is somewhat different from the
one last winter when we trudged into Maple Leaf
Lodge,” Virginia Cunningham commented, grinning
at the recollection. “Remember?”</p>

<p>“Can one ever forget?” chuckled Judy. Contentedly,
she drew a deep breath of the pine laden
mountain air. “No one to meet us ... a dreadful
snow storm ... the lodge closed ... and that horrible
caretaker!”</p>

<p>“A Scout camp is different, I promise you,” Miss
Ward assured the girls. “Everything is carefully
planned. Nothing ever is left to chance. We should
be there any minute now.”</p>

<p>Eagerly, the girls leaned forward in their seats,
striving for the first glimpse of the clear blue lake
which they knew would soon be visible through the
tall, stately pines. On either side of the curving road,
they saw rustic signs pointing out interesting trails.</p>

<p>“There it is!” suddenly cried Betty Bache.</p>

<p>To the right, the girls caught a flash of blue water.
A moment later, as the station wagon rounded another
curve, they saw the camp itself, a cluster of
tents, with main lodge and dining hall.</p>

<p>The station wagon pulled up at an office near the
entrance gate. Everyone scrambled out, unkinking
cramped legs. As the girls helped the driver unload
dunnage, Miss Ward went inside to register the patrol.
She was gone a long while. When finally she rejoined
the group, it was evident by the expression of
her face that something had gone wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
“Girls, I hate to tell you this&mdash;” she began apologetically.</p>

<p>“Don’t say we aren’t to stay!” exclaimed Beverly
Chester. “That would be the last straw!”</p>

<p>“We’re staying,” the teacher replied. “However,
there’s been a mix-up on reservations. Another patrol,
which wasn’t expected until next week, arrived
ahead of time.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no place for us?” Kathleen asked.</p>

<p>“Miss Lubell, the camp director, is extremely upset
about it. One tent, which sleeps four, is available.
If we can make out with that for tonight, more satisfactory
arrangements probably can be completed by
tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“There are seven of us,” Beverly pointed out.</p>

<p>“The more the merrier!” declared Judy cheerfully.
“I don’t mind being crowded for a night or two. For
that matter, it’s warm enough to sleep out under the
trees. We’ll get along fine.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” added Kathleen heartily, “Scouts
aren’t softies.”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d feel that way about it,” Miss Ward
said, pleased by the willingness of the girls to accept
inconvenience. “Miss Lubell is taking me in with
her, so that will make only six for the tent.”</p>

<p>After registration had been completed, the girls
were shown to their temporary quarters. They
stowed their dunnage, spread their blankets and
changed into informal camp clothes. Carefully reading
the rules posted on a bulletin board, they learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
that they would have only a half hour until the evening
meal would be served.</p>

<p>“Let’s see the beach at least,” Virginia proposed.
“We have a few minutes free time.”</p>

<p>A walk led down a gentle slope to Morning Glory
Lake, a deep bowl of deep blue, edged with a ruffle
of green forest. The beach had been cleared of stones
and sticks, extending for a long distance. There was
a roped off area for safe swimming, as well as a dock
to which were tied a sailboat and two rowboats.</p>

<p>Judy bent down to test the water with her finger.
“Cold,” she reported with a laugh. “It’s just as well, I
guess, because otherwise, I’d be tempted to leap in,
clothes and all!”</p>

<p>The girls of Beaver Patrol met the waterfront director,
their unit leader and several counselors.
Members of other patrols and troops came by to chat
and to provide scraps of information relative to camp
routine.</p>

<p>Several of the Beaver Patrol girls were inspecting
the outdoor ovens when the unit leader approached
the group.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Judy Grant,” she said.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” Judy said, separating herself from
the other girls. She could not guess why she had
been singled out for attention.</p>

<p>“I have a telegram for you. It came only a moment
ago from the village.”</p>

<p>“A telegram?” Judy repeated. She was startled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and stood staring at the yellow envelope which the
unit leader offered.</p>

<p>A half dozen fears assailed her. Her father or
mother might have been taken unexpectedly ill!
Perhaps her brother Ted had suffered an accident!
At the very least, something must have gone wrong
at home, and now it might be necessary for her to
return to Fairfield before the vacation really started.</p>

<p>“Well, Judy, why don’t you open it?” Virginia demanded.
“Don’t look so scared.”</p>

<p>“This is the first telegram I ever received,” Judy
replied, a bit shakily.</p>

<p>Ripping open the envelope, she scanned the message.
Her chubby face with its splattering of freckles
became a study as she read.</p>

<p>“Bad news?” Betty Bache finally asked.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly. It’s from Aunt Mattie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall having heard you speak of her,” remarked
Virginia.</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie is a character. She’s coming here for
two weeks.”</p>

<p>“To the Scout Camp?” Beverly inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Only to the resort area.” Judy folded the
telegram and placed it in the pocket of her slacks.
“Aunt Mattie, as usual, must have acted on impulse.
Anyway, she wants me to find her a nice cottage
with reasonable rent.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t a bed to call your own!” chuckled
Kathleen. “From what I’ve heard, space is at a
premium in this locality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
“That’s right,” agreed Ardeth. “I noted as we
drove up the mountain, that there were no vacancies
anywhere. Everything seemed to have been
taken.”</p>

<p>“I saw one place for rent,” Virginia informed the
group. “Remember that sign that said: ‘To Calico
Cave?’”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed it particularly,” nodded Judy. “I
was wondering if Calico Cave is only a name, or if
the road leads to a real cave.”</p>

<p>“A cottage that looked practically new stood on
the opposite side of the road,” Virginia went on. “It
was rather cute, I thought. At any rate, a signboard
in the yard said the place was for rent. A real estate
man’s name was given, but I didn’t make note of it.”</p>

<p>“That cottage may be just the ticket!” Judy declared.
“I’ll talk to Miss Ward, and if she says I
may, I’ll try to rent the place tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Actually, it was nearly noon the next day before
the girls gave further thought to Aunt Mattie’s
housing problem. Camp routine absorbed them
completely. There were so many fascinating things
to do, so many interesting places to explore, that
they neither desired nor sought permission to leave
Pine Cone.</p>

<p>A brisk swim in the lake preceded breakfast, and
after the camp work was done, there were classes in
nature lore and first aid.</p>

<p>At luncheon, however, Judy broached the problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
that was on her mind, showing Miss Ward the
telegram.</p>

<p>“I’m sure Aunt Mattie wouldn’t have made the
request, if she had realized how difficult it is to
obtain cottages here,” she apologized.</p>

<p>“Why, I think it’s nice your aunt is coming,” Miss
Ward replied. “Of course we’ll help her find a
place. <em>A Girl Scout’s duty is to be useful and to help
others.</em>”</p>

<p>“That’s law three,” Judy said with a relieved grin.
“I just didn’t want to put anyone to the trouble of
having to take me to the village. Aunt Mattie’s good
fun, and I’ll love having her near.”</p>

<p>Later that afternoon the Scout leader arranged
for all the girls in the Beaver Patrol to ride down
the mountain to the little town of Milburn, a railroad
and tourist center.</p>

<p>“I may as well tell you the bad news,” Miss Ward
remarked regretfully as the camp station wagon
rolled smoothly around the curves. “You’ll be
crowded into a single tent for another night or two.
Miss Lubell tried, but wasn’t able to make other arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t half bad last night,” Kathleen returned.
“We’ll manage.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” added Judy cheerfully.</p>

<p>By this time, the station wagon approached a
crossroad which bisected the main highway nearly
at a right angle.</p>

<p>“There it is!” Ardeth cried, rolling down the car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
window. “The road to Calico Cave! That cottage
Virginia noticed is on the other side of the highway,
perched up on a slope among the trees. See it?”</p>

<p>“I do!” cried Judy. “Why, it’s a darling little cottage!
I’m sure Aunt Mattie would love it&mdash;if the
rent isn’t too high.”</p>

<p>“All rents are sky high in this area,” Beverly
Chester warned. “I’ll bet they’re asking a small fortune
for the place. Probably that’s why it’s vacant.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, it will do no harm to inquire,” Judy
said. As the station wagon halted for a moment, she
jotted down the name of the real estate agent, who
offered the cottage for rent.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the girls were in Milburn,
standing at the door of the Timothy F. Krumm
Realty Co. office.</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm was busy making entries in a book,
but he laid aside his pen as the Scouts approached
his cluttered desk. He was a baldish, middle-aged
man with a nervous habit of moistening his lips.</p>

<p>Judy introduced the group, and mentioned her
interest in the cottage which was for rent. Timidly,
she inquired the rental price.</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk about price,” Mr. Krumm said
briskly. “First, I want you to see Calico Cottage.
Five beautiful rooms, including kitchen, fully
equipped, and a tiled bath with hot and cold running
water. A collosal bargain! And you’ll not find
another cottage vacant within six miles of Morning
Glory Lake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Judy glanced uneasily at Miss Ward and remained
silent. She very much feared that “the bargain”
would be offered at a price too steep for Aunt
Mattie’s modest pocketbook.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” she began doubtfully. “My
aunt isn’t prepared to pay a very high rental&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give that detail no thought,” Mr. Krumm insisted.
“I’ll run you up there in my car. If you like
the cottage&mdash;and you’ll be crazy about it&mdash;we can
come to terms.”</p>

<p>Almost before she could think, Judy was escorted
to the realtor’s car which was parked at the curb.
Miss Ward, Virginia and Ardeth also decided to accompany
them, while the others elected to wait in
the village.</p>

<p>During the swift ride up the mountain road, Mr.
Krumm talked endlessly, extolling the virtues of the
cottage he hoped to rent.</p>

<p>“It’s a classy little place,” he told the girls. “Brand
spanking new! You’ll not find a snappier cottage
anywhere in the area.”</p>

<p>“But the rental&mdash;” Judy began again.</p>

<p>“Now don’t try to get the cart before the horse,”
Mr. Krumm interrupted once more. “Just hold your
ponies until you see the cottage.”</p>

<p>Soon the car drew up amid the tall pines, in a
lonely but lovely section of the forest. Mr. Krumm
went ahead to remove the front door key from beneath
an over-sized rubber “Welcome” mat on the
porch. He unlocked the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
“No neighbors hereabouts to bother one,” he asserted,
stepping aside so that the girls might enter.
“You’ll find everything in apple-pie order. Two airy
bedrooms. Good mattresses. Nice draperies. Everything
the very best&mdash;top hole!”</p>

<p>“It seems a bit musty,” Miss Ward commented.</p>

<p>“Oh, the place needs an airing,” Mr. Krumm replied,
quickly raising the windows. “You know how
it is after a cottage has been closed for a long
while.”</p>

<p>“A long while?” the teacher repeated. “Then
you’ve had no recent renters?”</p>

<p>“That was a slip of tongue, a mere figure of
speech,” the real estate man said carelessly. “You
like the place?”</p>

<p>“It is attractive,” Judy said after completing a
quick inspection of the kitchen. “My aunt though,
will be alone. She requires only one bedroom. So
I’m afraid the rent may be too high.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what! I’ll make you a special offer,” Mr.
Krumm said, eyeing the girl shrewdly. “That is, I
will if you’ll agree that the cottage will be occupied
for the full period of the rental. Say, fifty dollars?”</p>

<p>“A week?”</p>

<p>“For the two weeks. You can’t say that isn’t a generous
offer. Rents are high at Morning Glory Lake.”</p>

<p>“It’s a very reasonable rental, I’m sure,” Judy
agreed. “There isn’t anything&mdash;wrong with the
place?”</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm drew himself up haughtily. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
an idea! I take a shine to you girls and offer you a
real bargain. Then you think there’s something
wrong with the cottage! You think I’m pulling a fast
one, handing you a cabbage!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Judy apologized hastily. “My question
wasn’t tactful. The cottage is beautifully furnished.
If Miss Ward says it is all right, I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt should be quite comfortable here,”
Miss Ward replied after a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Fine!” Mr. Krumm approved. He whipped a receipt
book from his pocket. “Now if you’ll kindly
pay in advance, we’ll close the deal on the spot.”</p>

<p>Judy had brought only twenty-five dollars with
her, but Miss Ward advanced the remainder, knowing
she would be repaid. Mr. Krumm then handed
over the key. Judy asked him if he would mind if
the cottage were put to use before the arrival of her
aunt.</p>

<p>“The rent’s paid, and the place is yours, for better
or for worse,” the realtor replied. “All I ask is that
you don’t come running to me with complaints, or a
demand for a return of your money. The deal’s
final.”</p>

<p>“That’s understood,” Judy agreed.</p>

<p>Having pocketed the fifty dollars, Mr. Krumm
seemed eager to be away.</p>

<p>“You may want to look the place over more carefully,”
he said quickly. “I have a pressing engagement
in town. Suppose I have your friends pick you
up in the camp station wagon. Okay?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
“Yes, that will be satisfactory,” Miss Ward replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” Mr. Krumm said, apparently
as an after-thought. “Better keep that door to the
cellar locked.”</p>

<p>“Door?” Judy repeated with misgiving. “I didn’t
notice a door. Is there a special reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm did not wait for her to complete the
question. The girls were certain he heard and
wished to avoid answering. At any rate, without
offering further information, he tipped his hat and
hastened down the weed-grown path to his car.</p>

<span>THE LOCKED DOOR</span></h2>


<p class="noi">MISS Ward and the Scouts watched Mr. Krumm
drive away with mingled feelings. Already they
were wondering if they had made a mistake in renting
the cottage.</p>

<p>“‘For better or for worse,’” Judy echoed the
real estate man’s words. “‘Final deal.’ It all has an
ominous sound.”</p>

<p>“Especially that remark about the locked door,”
remarked Virginia. “But the rent seemed so attractive.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, it was the only place available,” Ardeth
pointed out. “So why worry?”</p>

<p>Judy left the porch to inspect the foundation of
the building. Stooping, she ran an exploratory hand
across the crumbling mortar between the bricks.</p>

<p>“This cottage may be brand spanking new,” she
remarked, “but the building foundation certainly
isn’t! Not that it matters, if the place is comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what Mr. Krumm meant about
keeping the cellar door locked,” Virginia said.
“Let’s investigate.”</p>

<p>However, before the girls could reenter the cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
a milk delivery truck rolled into the private
drive. From the cab leaped a young driver with
reddish hair and a carefree smile. A frisky black
and white short-haired dog trotted at his heels as he
came over to the porch with a wire rack filled with
milk bottles.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” he said politely, doffing his
white cap. “I see you are moving in. Will you be
needing any milk or cream?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a quart of milk,” Miss Ward decided,
selecting a bottle from the rack.</p>

<p>“How about regular delivery?”</p>

<p>“We’ve rented the cottage for my aunt, who
won’t be here for a day or two,” Judy explained. “If
you’ll drop by later on, I’m certain she’ll sign up.”</p>

<p>“Cloverleaf supplies the best,” the young man
said. “My name, by the way, is Bart Ranieau.”</p>

<p>“You must be of French descent,” Miss Ward remarked.</p>

<p>“My father came from France, but I inherited my
red hair and my temper from my mother. I’m a
mixture&mdash;like Pete here.”</p>

<p>The cheerful milkman indicated the little dog
that was sniffing at Judy’s heels.</p>

<p>“He’s real cute,” she declared, patting him. “You
call him Pete?”</p>

<p>“He’s mine only by adoption,” Bart replied. “He
kept following my truck, so finally I let him ride.
Now he sticks like a burr. Never could find his
owner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Picking up the rack of bottles which he had set
down on the porch, the young milkman turned to
leave. Directing his remark at Judy, he said in an
offhand way: “Your aunt is the hardy type, I hope.
Not the kind that worries about strange noises?”</p>

<p>“We-ll,” Judy replied, startled by the odd question.
“Aunt Mattie is inclined to be nervous. Is
there any reason why she should worry about this
place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the cottage is okay so far as I know,” Bart
answered evasively. “I’d be the last person to run
it down, particularly when Old Krumm is so desperate
for a renter.”</p>

<p>“Desperate? Oh, dear, we thought it was just the
opposite!”</p>

<p>“That you were getting a bargain?”</p>

<p>Judy nodded miserably. “Now it proves to be a
lemon!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that!” the milkman corrected her.
“And the cottage <em>is</em> a bargain for anyone hardy
enough to stay here.”</p>

<p>“But what’s wrong with the place?” Judy demanded.</p>

<p>“Maybe your aunt won’t find anything out of the
way,” Bart said, edging off with his rack of bottles.
“I shouldn’t have said a word. Old Krumm would
have a fit if he knew I’d so much as opened my
kisser.”</p>

<p>“Those noises&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
“Forget ’em. Forget I said a thing. You can take
my word for it, there’s nothing really harmful or
dangerous about Calico Cottage.”</p>

<p>The Scouts followed Bart and his dog down the
walk, trying to learn more. But the young milkman
obviously was in retreat. With a friendly wave of
his hand, he sprang into the delivery wagon and
with Pete at his side drove off.</p>

<p>“There <em>is</em> something wrong with this cottage!”
Judy declared with firm conviction. “That young
man spoke of strange noises.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they have a connection with that locked
door Mr. Krumm mentioned,” Ardeth said. “Judy,
I think you’ve rented a house with a mystery!”</p>

<p>“If that’s all that’s wrong with it, I’ll be pleasantly
surprised!” Judy responded, her voice grim, “I wish
I could get my money back.”</p>

<p>“No chance of that, I’m afraid,” commented Miss
Ward. “Mr. Krumm warned us the deal was final.
He may have taken advantage of us. That remains
to be seen.”</p>

<p>“Let’s really inspect the cottage,” Virginia proposed.
“Mr. Krumm purposely took us through at
a whirlwind pace, so we wouldn’t notice too much.”</p>

<p>Dejectedly, the girls trooped into the cottage.
The living room was pleasant enough with a rug on
the floor, a slightly musty-smelling davenport,
chairs, a good reading light and attractive red calico
curtains at the windows.</p>

<p>Bedrooms also were well furnished and ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
wardrobe space had been provided. Water ran
rusty from the kitchen tap when Judy turned it on.</p>

<p>“Apparently, the cottage has been empty a long
while,” she remarked. “I guess Mr. Krumm tagged
me for an easy mark all right!”</p>

<p>“If you were taken in, so was I,” said Miss Ward.
“All the same, I can’t for the life of me see very
much wrong with this place.”</p>

<p>“Let’s inspect the kitchen,” Virginia urged.
“Probably the drain won’t work.”</p>

<p>The sink proved to be an attractive new unit with
shiny faucets and an unmarred enamel finish. Judy,
testing the drain, found that it worked perfectly.</p>

<p>Ardeth had turned her attention to the big electric
refrigerator. When she plugged in the cord, the
machinery began to hum.</p>

<p>“Nothing out-of-order here,” she reported.</p>

<p>Miss Ward meanwhile, quietly had been checking
the kitchen doors. One opened onto a back
porch and another into a storage room. The third
one, which apparently led down to the cellar, was
locked.</p>

<p>She turned the knob and rattled it a couple of
times.</p>

<p>“Any key?” Judy inquired.</p>

<p>“None in the door.”</p>

<p>“Why do you suppose it’s kept locked?” Ardeth
speculated. “Is there any reason why we shouldn’t
inspect the cellar? After all, it’s part of the cottage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
“In a way, it isn’t,” Judy remarked. “I’m certain
from examining the foundation of this place, that
the cottage was built on an old base.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything so mysterious about a
locked cellar door,” Virginia asserted, losing interest.
“Like enough, the basement is damp and musty.
So Mr. Krumm advised keeping the door locked.”</p>

<p>“Why should he tell us to keep it locked, when
we have no key with which to open it?” Ardeth demanded.
She was struck by an intriguing thought.
“Say, maybe that key is here somewhere!”</p>

<p>“I know I’m not going to waste time searching for
it,” Judy declared. “I am a bit worried though,
about that milkman’s reference to strange noises. I
wish I could be sure the cottage is all right before
Aunt Mattie moves in.”</p>

<p>“There is a way,” Miss Ward returned. “We
could sleep here for a night. In fact, it would relieve
the congestion at Pine Cone Camp. We might try
it tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” cried Virginia enthusiastically. “It
would be fun!”</p>

<p>“We could stock the cottage larder and have
everything ready for your aunt when she comes,
Judy,” added Ardeth with equal zest for the proposal.
“How about it?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay,” declared Judy. “It will give us a
chance to learn if anything is wrong with the cottage.”</p>

<p>The girls remained on the premises another half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
hour. By the time they were ready to return to Pine
Cone Camp, their friends drove up in the station
wagon.</p>

<p>“At least Mr. Krumm relayed our message,” Ardeth
said, as she climbed into the car. “Maybe he
isn’t such a bad egg after all.”</p>

<p>From Calico Cottage, the station wagon followed
a smooth pavement which wound in easy curves up
the mountain. At a lookout point, the driver halted
briefly to permit the girls to obtain a view of the
distant peaks and valleys. They went on again, but
presently were stopped by a forest ranger, whose
green car was parked at the roadside.</p>

<p>“What have we done now?” Beverly Chester muttered
uneasily.</p>

<p>The ranger greeted the campers courteously,
dropping a handful of literature into Miss Ward’s
lap.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Old Baldy Mountain,” he said.
“This entire area is a national forest preserve.
You’re staying at Pine Cone Camp?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we arrived last night,” Miss Ward replied.</p>

<p>“Girl Scouts always are careful about starting
fires,” the ranger continued. “I wish other visitors
here were as cooperative. You’re familiar with the
regulations. The most important one is never to
start a fire except in the designated places. You’ll
find them all marked on the forest map.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful,” Miss Ward promised.</p>

<p>“My name is Arthur Wentz,” the ranger ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
his little talk. “If I can be of service at any time, let
me know.”</p>

<p>Back at Pine Cone Camp a few minutes later, the
girls found they had just enough time for a brisk
swim in the lake before dinner.</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen, who were good swimmers,
were paired together. They tried their skill on the
diving board, watched a group of other Scouts receiving
instruction in Red Cross Life Saving, showered
off and were ready for a hot meal when it was
served promptly at 5:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Later, when all the girls had gathered for songs
and a nature talk in the main lodge room, Miss
Lubell mentioned a plan whereby all interested patrols
would take part in a competitive first-aid
expedition.</p>

<p>“It will work like this,” she related. “Arrangements
have been made for a forest patrol plane to
drop messages to the various Scout groups which
will scatter over the mountainside. The notes will
provide fictional location of a plane crash. The patrols
are to proceed as quickly as possible to the site
of the crash, administer first aid and summon help.
There will be an award for the patrol which accomplishes
its mission first and with the most skill.”</p>

<p>“If it’s all to be imaginary, how will we give first
aid?” Betty Bashe asked in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Everything will be worked out carefully,” Miss
Lubell replied, with a smile. “Although the crash
is to be imaginary, counselors will be at the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
site selected. Notes pinned on their clothing, will
provide clues as to the type of injury supposedly
suffered. For example, one counselor may have an
imaginary broken arm. The unit reaching the scene
first, will be expected to care for the injuries exactly
as if they were real.”</p>

<p>“Say, that will give us first class experience,”
Kathleen declared enthusiastically. “I hope Beaver
Patrol wins!”</p>

<p>Next day in camp the girls were given opportunity
to brush up on previous first aid training, and
patrol leaders received maps of the mountain area
in the vicinity of Pine Cone Camp.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, when not otherwise absorbed
by camp activities, the girls of Beaver Patrol
pored over the map, thoroughly familiarizing
themselves with every road and trail.</p>

<p>After lunch a telegram came for Judy from her
Aunt Mattie Meadows, announcing that she would
arrive in two days at Milburn.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t give us too long to prepare the cottage
and make certain that everything is satisfactory
there,” Judy remarked, as she showed Miss Ward
the message. “Will we be permitted to stay at the
cottage tonight?”</p>

<p>“I’ve talked it over with Miss Lubell,” the Scout
leader replied. “While she considers it irregular for
any of the girls to remain away from the camp, she
realizes that through no fault of hers or ours, one
of the tents is badly overcrowded. So until that situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
can be corrected, she is granting permission
for three of the girls, and myself, to sleep at the
cottage. We’ll prepare our own breakfasts there,
and then return here for the day’s program.”</p>

<p>“We’re staying at Calico Cottage tonight then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Kathleen, as patrol leader, will remain here
with Beverly and Betty. Ardeth and Virginia will
go with us to the cottage. The camp station wagon
will take us to Milburn where we can buy necessary
supplies. Then we’ll be deposited at Calico Cottage,
and be picked up again tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>The plan was acceptable to everyone, although
Kathleen, Beverly and Betty secretly were a bit disappointed
that they were not to be included in the
party.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” Miss Ward assured them. “Perhaps
tomorrow night, we can trade places.”</p>

<p>At four o’clock, the station wagon came to take
Miss Ward, Judy, Ardeth and Virginia to the Village.
Most of their luggage was left behind, but
each girl had packed a few essentials which would
be needed for the over-night stay.</p>

<p>At Milburn, the Scouts sought a grocery store,
there to make careful purchase of a list of supplies
they had worked out. As she paid for the groceries,
Judy remarked that they were to be used at Calico
Cottage.</p>

<p>“Calico Cottage?” repeated the woman who had
waited upon her. “Don’t tell me you’re staying at
that place!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“Yes, we are for a few days,” Judy admitted. “I
rented the cottage for my aunt. Until she comes, a
few of the Scouts plan to use some of the bed
space.”</p>

<p>“You may like the cottage,” the woman replied.
“No one could hire me to stay there though!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Judy inquired, instantly alert. “What
<em>is</em> wrong with the cottage?”</p>

<p>“That’s what folks around here would like to
know,” the woman replied with an expressive shrug
of her shoulders. “It’s close to Hager’s Hole for one
thing.”</p>

<p>“Hager’s Hole?”</p>

<p>“Some call it Calico Cave.” The clerk rang up
the sale and packed the groceries into sacks for
convenient carrying. She did not seem inclined to
carry on the conversation.</p>

<p>“Please tell us what you know about the cottage,”
Judy requested earnestly.</p>

<p>“Really, I don’t know a thing. I shouldn’t have
said a word. It’s just that it seems sort of queer
about the tenants.”</p>

<p>“Did anything happen to them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” the woman answered. “But the last
couple stayed only two days. They moved out in
the middle of the night. Since then Mr. Krumm
hasn’t been able to find another renter.”</p>

<span>HAGER’S HOLE</span></h2>


<p class="noi">THE sun had lowered behind the spruce trees as
the camp station wagon unloaded three sober-faced
Scouts and their leader at the doorstep of Calico
Cottage.</p>

<p>“I’m not certain that we should stay here,” Miss
Ward remarked uneasily. “All this talk we’ve heard
about the place makes me wonder if I’m acting
wisely to allow the group to remain overnight.”</p>

<p>“And I’m worried about Aunt Mattie coming
here,” Judy added. “I wish I never had taken the
cottage. We’ve rented a lemon, that’s certain.”</p>

<p>The girls had been unable to glean any definite
information from the woman in the grocery store.
However, her observation that other tenants repeatedly
had moved out, had filled them with misgiving.</p>

<p>At Miss Ward’s suggestion, Judy had gone to Mr.
Krumm to ask for a rent refund. He had rejected
the request, impatiently assuring her that nothing
was wrong with the cottage.</p>

<p>“I thought Girl Scouts had nerve,” he lectured
her. “What happens? You hear a few busybodies
passing gossipy remarks, and immediately jump to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
false conclusions. When you rented the cottage I
gave you a good price on it with the understanding
that you’d stick by the deal. Now you come crying
to me before you’ve spent even a night in the
place.”</p>

<p>“Girl Scouts do have nerve,” Judy had replied,
carefully controlling her temper. “We believe in being
cautious though. And we don’t like to be misled
or cheated.”</p>

<p>“It was your own proposition,” Mr. Krumm retorted.
“You wanted the cottage and you got it. I’m
making no refund!”</p>

<p>So now, as the three Scouts stood on the porch
waiting as Miss Ward unlocked the door, they were
wondering what the night might bring forth.</p>

<p>There was little conversation as the girls quietly
set to work making the cottage more liveable. Ardeth
opened the windows to air out the rooms.
Virginia made up the beds, while Judy and Miss
Ward put away the groceries.</p>

<p>“You’re not much worried about staying here tonight
are you?” Judy asked the leader as she stacked
eggs in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>“No. If I were, I’d take the girls back to Pine
Cone Camp,” Miss Ward replied. “Frankly though,
I don’t like the things we’ve heard. I can’t imagine
why tenants would leave here suddenly unless&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Calico Cottage may have a ghost,” Judy supplied
with a nervous giggle.</p>

<p>“Judy, we know there are no such things!”</p>

<p>“Maybe by staying here we can disprove the rumors
that have been circulating,” Judy said soberly.
“Now, if we could, that would be performing a real
service for Mr. Krumm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
An inspection of the cottage and the grounds immediately
surrounding it, proved reassuring. Save
that a musty, damp odor lingered in the dwelling
even after rooms had been thoroughly aired, the
girls could detect nothing amiss.</p>

<p>“Our telephone is connected,” Miss Ward reported.
She had tested it by calling Miss Lubell at
Pine Cone Camp. “It’s reassuring to know that if
anything should go wrong, we’ll not be cut off from
help.”</p>

<p>“As we were last winter at Maple Leaf Lodge!”
Judy added with a laugh. “Remember how that
man, who pretended to be a caretaker, cut the
wires?”</p>

<p>“And the exciting time we had at Penguin Pass
with Monstro the Snowman!” contributed Virginia,
who had overheard the conversation. “Those were
the days!”</p>

<p>“You speak as if our adventures are over,” chuckled
Ardeth. “I have a hunch we may have a few
here at Calico Cottage before we’re through.”</p>

<p>The three girls became thoughtful as they reflected
upon a recent skiing excursion to Maple
Leaf Lodge on Candy Mountain. Judy, at the time,
had been a Tenderfoot Scout. However, she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
proven her courage and by passing difficult tests,
had moved up in rank.</p>

<p>For that matter, not only Judy, but the entire patrol
had won the admiration of villagers by the efficient
manner in which the capture of a dangerous
criminal had been accomplished. This story of the
Girl Scouts’ meeting with a clever impersonator has
been told in the first volume of a series, entitled:
“The Girl Scouts at Penguin Pass.”</p>

<p>Judy and Ardeth peeled potatoes for the evening
meal, set the table and prepared a simple salad.</p>

<p>“Anything more?” Judy then inquired.</p>

<p>“Not for awhile,” Miss Ward replied. “The meat
loaf will take at least thirty minutes more in the
oven. Then we’ll have dinner.”</p>

<p>“Mind if Ardeth and I do a bit of exploring?”</p>

<p>“Not if you’ll be back within half an hour.”</p>

<p>“We will,” Judy promised. “Want to come along,
Virginia?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, I’ll stay to help Miss Ward with last
minute things,” she decided. “Besides, I had enough
hiking this morning.”</p>

<p>Letting themselves out the screen door, Judy and
Ardeth walked through the aisle of tall trees to the
main highway. Then, without any discussion, they
turned into the narrow private road, and struck off
in the general direction of Calico Cave.</p>

<p>“No telling how far it may be,” Judy presently remarked.
“Or whether we can find it quickly. I simply
have to see that place!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
“Caves always fascinated me,” declared Ardeth,
walking fast to keep up with her friend. “I hope
this one has stalactites.”</p>

<p>For awhile, the girls walked directly into the setting
sun. The road was hemmed in on either side
with stately evergreens which spiced the air with a
pleasant fragrance. Presently, hearing a sound behind
her, Judy looked back and was astonished to
see a small dog following almost at her heels. She
halted to coax him to her. He wagged his stub tail,
and licked her hand affectionately.</p>

<p>“Why, Ardeth, it’s Pete!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not the milkman’s dog?”</p>

<p>“It’s the same dog, I’m sure. Do you suppose he
jumped off the milk truck and is lost?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t act lost,” Ardeth rejoined as the animal
started on ahead of Judy. “In fact, he seems to
know right where he’s going.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we should catch him,” Judy said doubtfully.
“He might get lost in the woods.”</p>

<p>The two Scouts started after Pete, but the faster
they hurried, the more distance the dog put between
them. Now and then, he would pause to look
back and bark, as if to tell them that he thoroughly
enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>Presently the weed-grown private road came to
a dead-end in a loop which permitted a car to turn
around and retravel the route it had come. A
weather-beaten signboard read: “To Calico Cave,”
its painted arrow pointing up a rocky trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
“Come back here, Pete!” Judy called. “Why, you
little scamp!”</p>

<p>Paying not the slightest heed, the dog trotted up
the trail.</p>

<p>“He acts as if he’s been here before,” Ardeth observed.
“Maybe he’s trying to guide us to the cave!”</p>

<p>“We really should turn back,” Judy said. “Oh,
well, if we hurry, maybe we’ll have time to take a
quick peek at the cave.”</p>

<p>Struggling up the sharp incline, the girls soon
came to an opening amid the tall bushes. To their
right was an expanse of limestone rock, badly
eroded by the elements.</p>

<p>“There it is! The cave!” Judy cried as she discerned
a small, dark opening.</p>

<p>Pete had gone directly to the entrance and stood
there, barking and jerking his head, as if to beckon
the girls.</p>

<p>“That dog has been here before all right!” Judy
declared. “Otherwise he wouldn’t be so excited
about the place.”</p>

<p>With Ardeth close behind, she picked her way
across the rocky path to the projecting shelf. The
cave opening was barely shoulder height and not
more than four feet wide.</p>

<p>Curiously, Judy peered down into the dark interior.
“It’s just a narrow passage leading gradually
into a deep endless hole,” she reported. “I imagine
though, that the cave may open up into a large
chamber somewhere below. Want to explore?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
“You and your jokes!”</p>

<p>Judy laughed and turned to leave. Ardeth however,
crouched down to direct her gaze into the
opening.</p>

<p>“I can hear water dripping,” she reported. “Say,
why do you suppose the name of this place was
changed from Hager’s Hole to Calico Cave? Or are
they one and the same?”</p>

<p>“Ask Pete,” Judy replied with a chuckle. “He
seems to know more about the place than we do.”</p>

<p>She whistled to attract the dog’s attention, but
he paid her no heed. Even after she and Ardeth
started down the path, he kept sniffing at the cave
entrance.</p>

<p>“Come on, Pete!” Judy called impatiently.</p>

<p>“Maybe he thinks he’ll find a rabbit down in that
hole,” Ardeth remarked. “I hate to leave him here
alone. I’ve heard of dogs losing themselves in
caves.”</p>

<p>“He’ll come in a minute or two,” Judy returned.
“He’s only trying to tease us.”</p>

<p>Pete, however, did not follow the girls. At the
bend of the path, they looked back again. Even as
they called to him, he barked and vanished into the
dark hole.</p>

<span>NIGHT SOUNDS</span></h2>

<p class="noi">“WHY, that crazy Pete!” Judy cried as she saw
the dog disappear into the opening. “He went into
the cave!”</p>

<p>Worried lest the pet lose himself in the dark
cavern, the girls quickly ran back to the shelf of
projecting rock.</p>

<p>Anxiously, Judy peered into the deep, rather
terrifying hole.</p>

<p>“Pete!” she called. “Pete! Come back here!”</p>

<p>The little dog could not be seen, but the girls
heard a muffled, answering bark. It seemed to come
from far down in the bowels of the rock.</p>

<p>“He’s a long distance in,” Judy said anxiously.
“What’ll we do, Ardeth? Go after him?”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t dare,” the other decided. “It’s
dangerous to explore caves without taking precautions.
Besides, Miss Ward is expecting us at
the cottage.”</p>

<p>“Pete may never find his way out. That’s what
worries me.”</p>

<p>The dog’s smothered bark gradually faded until
no sound could be heard. Thrusting head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
shoulders into the hole, Judy tried again to catch
a glimpse of the truant pet.</p>

<p>“Not a sign of him,” she reported hopelessly. “All
we can do is report to Bart Ranieau. He was such
a nice little dog&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you see him?” Ardeth demanded as Judy
broke off her remark.</p>

<p>For a long moment, Judy made no reply. Then
she pulled her head out of the opening, staring at
her friend rather wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Ardeth questioned. “Did you
see a ghost?”</p>

<p>“You look down there in that hole,” Judy urged.
“Tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>Ardeth moved in close beside her, peering into
the darkness. A gust of wind ruffled her hair and
nearly bowled her headlong into the cave. She
grasped a projection of limestone rock for support.</p>

<p>“See it?” Judy demanded.</p>

<p>“Pete, you mean?”</p>

<p>“No! No! Look far down the passageway,
Ardeth.”</p>

<p>Try as she would, Ardeth could see nothing
save empty space. Now that her eyes were becoming
more accustomed to the blackness, she could
make out a white rock floor, and on the ceiling,
a wet patch where grew a tight mat of lichens.
But that was all.</p>

<p>“Look down,” Judy directed again. “I’m sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
I didn’t imagine that I saw something moving in
the passageway.”</p>

<p>Once more Ardeth directed her gaze below, and
involuntarily stiffened.</p>

<p>“Now I see it!” she exclaimed. “Why, it looks
like a moving light!”</p>

<p>“I thought so too,” Judy agreed. “You don’t
suppose anyone could be down there?”</p>

<p>“At this late hour?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem likely, does it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe Calico Cave has a ghost,” Ardeth declared
with a nervous giggle. “Wouldn’t that be
something!”</p>

<p>Judy had peered into the cave again. “The light
is moving away, descending the passageway,” she
reported. “Ardeth, Pete may have started down
there to investigate.”</p>

<p>“If he did, he’s welcome to the job! Just to look
down into that ink well gives me the jitters. Poor
Pete! We’ll never see him again, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Someone will have to get him out,” Judy insisted.
“It would be too heartless to let him die in
there. Miss Ward will know what to do.”</p>

<p>Though she would not have admitted it, the
moving light which seemed to have no explanation,
had somewhat unnerved her. With dusk coming
on, she was eager to be away from the lonely
locality.</p>

<p>“Okay,” Judy agreed reluctantly.</p>

<p>Before getting up from the crouched position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
she took a last look into the cave. The light had
vanished completely and Pete likewise could not
be seen.</p>

<p>“Since we can’t save Pete without risking our
safety, I guess we may as well hike for Calico Cottage,”
Ardeth declared quickly.</p>

<p>The chill of evening was in the air as the two
girls silently trudged back the way they had come.
A rising breeze whipped the evergreens overhead,
making ragged shadows, and causing the needles
to whisper mournfully. Far below, the White River
remained visible in the dying sunlight, a wide,
shining band of silvery blue.</p>

<p>At Calico Cottage, supper was nearly ready. Judy
and Ardeth, however, had little appetite. Dejectedly,
they related their discovery of the cave, and
their misfortune in losing Pete.</p>

<p>“You were wise not to try to venture into that
hole,” Miss Ward assured the two girls. “The dog
may wander out by himself. Even if he is lost,
the risk of trying to bring him out without a guide,
would be very great.”</p>

<p>“You really think Pete will get out by himself?”
Judy asked, brightening.</p>

<p>“He may. At any rate, he’ll survive for many
days. I’ll telephone the young milkman and tell
him his dog is lost. You’re certain the pet was his?”</p>

<p>“It was Pete, all right,” Ardeth answered. “He
acted as if he’d been in that cave before too.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s an excellent chance he may find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
his way out,” the troop leader asserted. “I’ll telephone
the dog’s owner now. Do you recall his
name, Judy?”</p>

<p>“Bart Ranieau.”</p>

<p>Miss Ward went directly to the telephone, but
was unable to contact the young man. She learned
that he roomed in the village, and was informed
by his landlady that after coming in from his milk
route, he had left without saying where he intended
to go.</p>

<p>“If we can’t get word to him by tomorrow morning,
I’ll notify the forest rangers,” Miss Ward decided.
“They’ll know how to proceed.”</p>

<p>As night came on, the girls washed all the
dishes and tidied the kitchen. The very nearness
of the cave and the knowledge that Pete was lost
somewhere in its vast recesses, tended to depress
them.</p>

<p>Virginia spoke somewhat wistfully of Pine Cone
Camp, speculating upon whether or not the other
Scouts might be having a ceremonial fire and singfest
there.</p>

<p>“We’re cut off from the fun here,” Judy acknowledged.
“It’s my fault too. If Aunt Mattie hadn’t
sent that telegram, we’d all be in camp together.”</p>

<p>“Considering the mix-up over reservations, the
sleeping arrangement is much better here,” Ardeth
declared. “Besides, we don’t want your aunt to
have this cottage if it isn’t suitable.”</p>

<p>“It’s a Girl Scout’s duty to be useful and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
help others,” added Virginia gravely. “At any rate,
we like Calico Cottage.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything wrong with the place,”
Ardeth picked up the conversation. “Of course, it’s
isolated and a bit lonely off here in the pines.
Now and then that musty odor hangs over the
place, and one can’t seem to localize it. The cottage
isn’t really damp.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been annoyed by that odor myself,” said
Miss Ward. “It was especially strong when first
we opened up the cottage. I wonder if it comes
from the cellar?”</p>

<p>“With that door locked, we can’t investigate,”
Judy responded. “What do you suppose became
of the key? And why did Mr. Krumm advise us to
keep the door locked? Those questions keep going
around in my mind.”</p>

<p>The evening passed slowly for the girls. Ardeth
sewed and the others tried to read. As a chill crept
over the cottage, Miss Ward lighted a heater which
made the living room more cheerful. By eight-thirty,
everyone was ready to go to bed.</p>

<p>“We must be abroad early in the morning,” Miss
Ward warned. “Breakfast at seven. The camp station
wagon will pick us up between eight-thirty
and nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>Judy and Ardeth had elected to share one of
the bedrooms, while Virginia and the teacher took
the adjoining chamber. The mattresses were surprisingly
comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Snuggling down into the covers, Judy closed
her eyes, but was annoyed to discover that she was
not sleepy. Ardeth, on the other hand, curled up
like a kitten, and soon was breathing with deep
regularity.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me anyhow?” Judy
asked herself. “I guess I can’t take the comforts
of home.”</p>

<p>For awhile, she stared out the open window,
watching the movement of the pine trees. A strong,
cool breeze had arisen. It flapped the calico draperies
and whistled around the corners of the flimsily-built
cottage.</p>

<p>Judy resolutely tried not to think of Calico Cave
or poor Pete, but the harder she struggled to banish
the unpleasant recollection, the more clearly it
emerged. She could visualize the little dog, wandering
helplessly deeper and deeper into the cavern,
always searching for an exit which never materialized.</p>

<p>“I’m becoming positively morbid!” she told herself
sternly. “Enough of this!”</p>

<p>Judy tossed off the blankets and taking care not
to disturb Ardeth, went quickly to the kitchen for
a drink of water.</p>

<p>The cottage was very still. Now that she was
abroad, Judy began to regret that she had left her
comfortable, warm bed. The kitchen was icy cold
and the only light came from a half moon which
shone eerily through the windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Judy drank a glass of water in the darkness, preferring
not to disturb any of the sleepers by switching
on a light. In the kitchen, the damp, unpleasant
odor which the girls had noted earlier, seemed
especially strong.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it comes from the basement,” she
thought, sniffing the air close to the locked door.
“Maybe this is why Mr. Krumm wants us to keep it
closed. But what can cause such an odor?”</p>

<p>Judy had started to move away when she was
startled by an unusual sound which seemed to come
from beneath the floor of the kitchen. The noise
assaulted her ears as a series of loud thumps.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” Judy thought, backing a step away
from the locked cellar door. “What’s going on
down there in the basement? Maybe this place does
have a ghost!”</p>

<p>If the loud thumping, bumping noise had startled
Judy, she was to suffer an even greater shock.</p>

<p>As she held herself rigid, straining to catch the
slightest sound, there arose from below, the clear
melodious notes of a flute!</p>

<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a><i>Chapter 5</i><br />
<span>SONG OF THE FLUTE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">JUDY stood transfixed, listening tensely. The musical
notes now had died out and in the kitchen
there was only silence. Had the strange notes of
the flute been no more than a trick of the imagination?</p>

<p>Suddenly she was aware of a sound in the room
beyond the kitchen. Judy whirled to see a white
apparition framed in the doorway. She uttered a
choked cry and then laughed aloud in relief. The
figure was no ghost, only Miss Ward in a white
bathrobe.</p>

<p>“Did I startle you?” the teacher asked in a whisper.
“It is you, Judy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I couldn’t sleep. I came out here to get a
drink of water. For a minute I thought you were
a ghost from the basement!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Judy!” Miss Ward reproved. “What nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I was joking,” Judy said hastily. “Of course,
everyone knows there are no ghosts. All the same,
that sound was unnerving.”</p>

<p>“Sound? What sound, Judy?”</p>

<p>“Well, it seemed to come from the cellar. First,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
I heard a series of loud thumps. Then, I thought
I heard someone playing the flute.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the sound drifted in from outside the
cottage.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it didn’t, Miss Ward.”</p>

<p>For several minutes the Scout leader listened
attentively, but the noises which had disturbed
Judy were not to be heard again.</p>

<p>“It is very late,” she said finally. “Judy, you must
go back to bed.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have awakened you. I tried to be
quiet.” As Judy started across the kitchen, the badly
constructed floor creaked beneath her slippered
feet. She had reached the living room doorway,
when she was brought up short by the high pitched
note of a musical instrument.</p>

<p>“There it is again, Miss Ward!” she whispered,
grasping the teacher’s arm. “A flute! Hear it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” the Scout leader replied. “It certainly
sounds like a reed or a wind instrument.” She
stood very still, listening.</p>

<p>From below the flooring issued a series of musical
notes, tuneless but not displeasing to the ear.
Then the kitchen again was enveloped in silence.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my imagination, Miss Ward. You
heard it too!”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t imagine it, Judy,” the teacher
soberly agreed. “The sound came from the basement,
or so it seemed to me.”</p>

<p>Crossing to the cellar door, Miss Ward twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the knob and pulled hard on it. “It’s still locked,”
she murmured. “I begin to understand why Mr.
Krumm was unwilling to make a refund on the
rent.”</p>

<p>“This explains why the other tenants moved out
so suddenly.”</p>

<p>“It may,” Miss Ward acknowledged. “Evidently,
there is a very good reason for keeping this door
locked.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose&mdash;anyone&mdash;could be down
there?” Judy said falteringly. “Maybe locked in?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been watching too many television
thrillers.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Judy admitted, laughing shakily.
“My theory is wild all right. How do you explain
the flute?”</p>

<p>“I don’t. However, I intend to talk to Mr. Krumm
tomorrow. If this cottage has a mystery or any
possible danger, it is his duty to inform us completely.
Now get to bed, Judy. I’ll sit up for awhile.”</p>

<p>Next morning, when Judy awoke from a deep
slumber, bright sunlight was streaming through the
slats of the venetian blinds. Ardeth already was up
and dressed.</p>

<p>“Breakfast in ten minutes,” she informed Judy,
giving her a hard shake. “If you don’t get a move
on, we’ll not be ready by the time the camp station
wagon calls for us.”</p>

<p>“I guess I overslept,” Judy mumbled, pulling out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of bed and groping blindly for her shirt and slacks.
“Is everything all right?”</p>

<p>“Is everything all right?” Ardeth echoed, starting
to air the bed. “What could go wrong so early
in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering, that’s all,” Judy answered,
deciding to postpone the tale of the flute until after
breakfast. “What smells so utterly delicious?”</p>

<p>“Bacon. Miss Ward and Virginia are cooking it.
We’ve been assigned to the dishes.”</p>

<p>Judy dressed speedily, helped Ardeth tidy the
bedroom, and was ready in time to help carry
dishes to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Miss Ward herself broached the subject of the
strange sounds which had been heard in the basement
during the night.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to alarm anyone,” she asserted,
pouring hot chocolate. “I feel though, that if we
are to stay here, we must be on the alert. Furthermore,
I intend to ask Mr. Krumm for an explanation.
I am sure there is one, and that he can provide
it.”</p>

<p>“If he will,” Judy added. “He certainly wasn’t
passing out any information when he rented this
cottage. I don’t know what to do about Aunt
Mattie.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately, she won’t be here for a day or two,”
Miss Ward replied. “We’ll have a little time in
which to try to clear up the situation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
As was to be expected, Ardeth and Virginia expressed
keen disappointment at having missed out
on the excitement. They asked a dozen questions,
and spent the entire breakfast period speculating
upon the nature of the mysterious basement sounds.</p>

<p>“Calico Cottage has a ghost!” Virginia insisted
gaily. “How thrilling! And a boy who plays a flute
is far more interesting than an ordinary apparition.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s a boy ghost?” Ardeth demanded.
“For all we know, it may be an old man
or a beautiful lady in white. My, I wish we could
get down into the cellar!”</p>

<p>“I can see you leading the way!” Virginia teased.
“Anyway, we have a more urgent problem.”</p>

<p>“That little dog,” interposed Judy, her face becoming
grave. “Something must be done to get him
out of the cave.”</p>

<p>Miss Ward told the girls that she had tried very
early that morning to get in touch with Bart Ranieau.
Though she had telephoned at seven o’clock,
he already had left his rooming house and was off
on his route.</p>

<p>“He may come this way,” she remarked hopefully.
“If he does, perhaps we can flag him down.
Otherwise, I’ll call the forest ranger headquarters
in the village.”</p>

<p>Breakfast finished, Judy and Ardeth cleared the
table and made a fast and furious attack upon the
dishes. As they rushed about, stacking china neatly
in the cupboards, they kept an attentive ear trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
on the cellar area. The only sounds came from out-of-doors.</p>

<p>“If Miss Ward hadn’t backed up your story about
that flute player, I’d have accused you of dreaming
it up,” Ardeth declared. “Just my luck to have
missed out on the fun.”</p>

<p>“It was scarey, rather than fun,” Judy answered.
“For Aunt Mattie’s sake, I hope our basement friend
doesn’t strike any more sour notes.”</p>

<p>Hanging up the dish towels to dry, the two
girls joined Miss Ward and Virginia who were
watching the highway for a glimpse of either the
station wagon or the milk truck.</p>

<p>“There it comes!” Virginia suddenly cried, spying
the vehicle driven by Bart Ranieau.</p>

<p>All the Scouts rushed to the main highway to
flag down the milk wagon.</p>

<p>“Hi!” Bart greeted the girls as he halted the
delivery wagon at the side of the road. “I see you’ve
moved in. Need milk or butter this morning?”</p>

<p>“We can use two quarts of milk,” Miss Ward
returned. “But we stopped you for another reason.”</p>

<p>“It’s about Pete,” Ardeth said tensely. “He lost
himself in the cave last night. Judy and I called
to him, but he wouldn’t come out. He kept going
deeper and deeper in the hole.”</p>

<p>She broke off in the report, suddenly aware that
the young milkman was smiling in an odd sort
of way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“That Pete!” he remarked. “He’s a natural-born
spelunker.”</p>

<p>“A what?” demanded Judy.</p>

<p>“A spelunker. That’s what modern cave explorers
call themselves. The science of caves is called speleology.”</p>

<p>Bart motioned for the girls to step over to the
milk wagon. Peering in, they saw Pete sprawled
comfortably on a rug, lying on the floor. He was
fast asleep, his head resting on his forepaws.</p>

<p>“Pete found his own way out of the cave, as he
usually does,” Bart explained. “I’ve tried to keep
him out, but no soap. One of these days, he may
lose his life in there.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, he’s safe now,” Judy declared,
greatly relieved. “Is the cave very deep?”</p>

<p>“The exit never has been found.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Ardeth’s eyes opened wide. “I guess
Calico Cave is an unsafe place.”</p>

<p>“One shouldn’t venture in very far without a
guide. Some ten years ago, a very courageous man
whom I knew rather well, lost his life down there.
He was seeking the cave exit. Since then, no one
has ventured past the point where he last was seen.”</p>

<p>Judy inquired if Calico Cave and Hager’s Hole
were one and the same place. Bart replied that
they were identical.</p>

<p>“For years the cave was known as Hager’s Hole,”
he explained. “It was named for old Captain Hager,
who once owned this property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“Our cottage?” Virginia asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Not the cottage. But the Hager home used to
stand in the same location. Mr. Krumm bought the
place not so long ago. He tore down the old house
and put up a new cottage on the original foundation.
Folks advised him not to do it, but no one
can tell Krumm anything!”</p>

<p>“He’s had a little trouble renting the cottage?”
Judy probed.</p>

<p>“Oh, renters came along fast enough, but they
wouldn’t stay!” the milkman chuckled. “Some of
’em, it seems, were allergic to strange sounds. I take
it you folks spent a comfortable night?”</p>

<p>“We were disturbed once,” Miss Ward answered.
“Nothing serious. We fancied we heard a flute
player.”</p>

<p>“No ghosts?” Bart asked, grinning.</p>

<p>“Nary a ghost,” Miss Ward returned. “Naturally
we were a bit disturbed about the music, and intend
to seek an explanation.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ranieau, you seem to be quite familiar with
Calico Cave,” Judy remarked pointedly. “Could
you, by chance, tell us why the name was changed,
and maybe explain the mystery of the cottage?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I could,” Bart said, grinning in an odd
way. “I like you folks. You have more nerve than
those other renters. Maybe, if you ask pretty, I’ll
tell you the story of the Old White Witch.”</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a><i>Chapter 6</i><br />
<span>THE WHITE WITCH</span></h2>

<p class="noi">BART Ranieau’s remark about the White Witch
intrigued the girls, who immediately pleaded with
him to tell them the story connected with the cave.</p>

<p>“Okay,” he agreed, “but I’m late on my route
this morning, so I’ll have to make the tale brief.
Calico Cave is very old. It was here before the village
was incorporated and has had a half dozen
names over the years.</p>

<p>“According to an ancient legend, an old witch
once lived in the cave, arousing the villagers by
casting horrible spells upon them. In their terror
they called upon a monk who once resided in the
mountains, to turn the old hag into stone. So now
in a chamber of the cave you may see a strange
stalagmite formation&mdash;the White Witch.”</p>

<p>“Is that a true story?” Virginia asked, deeply
impressed.</p>

<p>“The legend is true. As for the White Witch, you
can see her if you’ve a mind to explore as far as the
first chamber.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that tale yourself, I take it?”
Miss Ward inquired with a broad smile.</p>

<p>“I think the story was made up to explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
white formation, which does resemble a witch,”
Bart answered. “Over the years, the yarn took
on more and more detail and color.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to see that old stalagmite witch,” Judy
declared, her dark eyes sparkling. “How deep down
in the cave is the formation?”</p>

<p>“Too far for you to explore alone,” the milkman
responded. “Don’t try it. Not without a guide.
Caves are safe enough, if one takes precautions,
but they’re no place for amateur explorers, unsupervised.”</p>

<p>“Does Calico Cave have any other interesting
formations besides the Witch?” Judy inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, gobs of ’em. Few persons though, have
gone past the old White Witch. In fact, it’s part of
the legend that she casts a spell upon all who go
beyond that point in the cave.”</p>

<p>“You’ve disproved that part of the legend?” the
Girl Scout leader questioned.</p>

<p>“Well, the old witch cast her spell over me all
right,” Bart admitted with a chuckle. “Not an evil
one though. The Cave fascinates me, and if I had
time, I’d really delve into its innermost secrets.”</p>

<p>“Ardeth and I thought we saw a moving light in
the cavern late yesterday afternoon,” Judy remarked.
“Maybe you were down there exploring.”</p>

<p>“Not yesterday,” Bart replied. “You’re certain
you saw a light?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it startled us. Either someone was down
in the cave, or it was that old witch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
“It wasn’t the old witch,” Bart assured her. “She’s
a harmless old gal and has stayed fixed for a thousand
years, more or less. I can’t guess who might
be down in the cave, because folks hereabouts
seldom venture in.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of former Calico Cottage renters
moving out because of strange sounds which disturbed
them,” Miss Ward reminded the young milkman.
“Can you tell us more about it?”</p>

<p>“Did the other folks ever hear a flute player?”
interposed Ardeth.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I heard some such talk.”</p>

<p>“And loud banging noises at night?” demanded
Judy.</p>

<p>“I reckon so.”</p>

<p>“Tell us everything!” urged Virginia. “Is Calico
Cottage supposed to be haunted? Is that why Mr.
Krumm has trouble keeping his renters?”</p>

<p>“All I know is what I hear,” Bart replied evasively.
“I wouldn’t have told you about the White
Witch, only I could tell that you Scouts aren’t
easily scared.”</p>

<p>“Is there any connection between Calico Cottage
and the Witch?” Judy questioned.</p>

<p>“Only as she’s supposed to have cast her spell
over the place. The last tenants had a cat. One
night she became scared at some noise and leaped
through a window, shattering the glass. The folks
moved out, came dawn. I know because I met ’em
as they were driving away. Tried to talk ’em into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
staying, but they were dead set the cottage was
haunted.”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe that nonsense yourself?” Miss
Ward inquired.</p>

<p>“Nope. I think there’s a logical explanation for
the cottage cutting up the way it does. I’d tip
Krumm off if he weren’t such a disagreeable egg.
He took advantage of old Captain Hager in buying
the property, and the townsfolk never quite forgave
him.”</p>

<p>“Is Captain Hager still alive?” questioned
Ardeth.</p>

<p>“Very much so,” Bart told her. “The old sea dog
is edging seventy now, but he’s as spry as ever.
Since Krumm got the old homestead away from
him, he’s lived frugally in a cabin down on the
river.”</p>

<p>“The cave, you said, was named for Captain
Hager?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it bore his name ever since I can remember.
Then Krumm bought all this property, including
the private road and the cave. Right off, he changed
the name to Calico Cave.”</p>

<p>“But why?” inquired Judy.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t want the cave to have Captain
Hager’s name, for one thing. There’s no love between
them, you know. Then I guess he thought
Hager’s Hole was too closely associated with talk
of the White Witch and death.”</p>

<p>“Death?” Ardeth repeated uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
“One man lost his life in the cave. Another explorer&mdash;an
amateur&mdash;broke his leg, and a searching
party had to bring him out. Not so many months
ago, a group of giddy girls went in without a guide.
They lost their way, and wandered around for
several hours before help got to them. The stories
they told around didn’t help any. So Krumm
changed the cave name.”</p>

<p>“I can see that the cavern is no drawing card,”
Miss Ward remarked. “When first I saw the cave
sign, I assumed that the place might be a tourist
attraction.”</p>

<p>“It could be,” Bart said seriously. “That cave has
everything! Fantastic formations beyond belief! An
underground river, a waterfall, everything to attract
visitors, if facilities could be provided. But
Krumm has no imagination, and he’s too tight to
spend a penny developing the cave. It’s a pity
the property ever came into his possession.”</p>

<p>The Scouts had a dozen more questions at the tip
of their tongues. Before they could ask any of
them, a familiar automobile drove up, parking
squarely in front of the Cloverleaf milk truck.</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm squeezed out from behind the wheel
and walked directly over to the group. He gazed
sharply at Bart, his attitude unfriendly.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d drop by to inquire how you’re
getting along,” he said, ignoring the milkman and
bowing to Miss Ward. “You have found the cottage
quite comfortable, I trust?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
“It seems to be very well equipped,” the teacher
conceded. “I can’t say we spent too comfortable a
night, though. We were disturbed by strange
sounds.”</p>

<p>“Strange sounds?” The real estate man registered
surprise which was not in the least convincing.</p>

<p>“We heard music, and thumping noises,” Judy
supplied. “It seems your cottage has a ghost.”</p>

<p>“No such thing!” Mr. Krumm indignantly denied.
“That’s all bosh! You’ve been listening to stupid
gossip.”</p>

<p>“You should have told us the truth about the
cottage before we rented it,” Miss Ward reproved
him mildly. “Judy’s aunt will be coming shortly,
and we hesitate to turn over a place to her that may
be unnerving or possibly unsafe.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong with the cottage,” Mr.
Krumm flared. “You’ve been talking to Bart Ranieau,
and he’s been filling you with hot air!”</p>

<p>“We were asking him about the cottage and likewise
about the cave,” Miss Ward admitted. “If
we’re to remain here another night, we want all
the information we can get.”</p>

<p>“I was telling ’em about the White Witch,” Bart
interposed to plague the realtor.</p>

<p>“How many times have I told you to keep your
nose out of my affairs?” Mr. Krumm demanded
furiously. “You can’t keep that wagging, clacking
tongue of yours still! You’ve driven away all of
my tenants, one by one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
“That’s not so, Krumm, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“You fill ’em up with fears about White Witches
and such nonsense. I want no more of it, understand?
Furthermore, I want you to keep off my
property. Don’t be snooping around Calico Cave
any more!”</p>

<p>“You can’t keep me from exploring,” Bart returned
coolly. “You may own the land, but not
what’s below the surface.”</p>

<p>“You stay out of that cave, and away from it,”
Mr. Krumm repeated his order.</p>

<p>Bart grinned provokingly, and without making
answer, drove off down the road.</p>

<p>“That young whippersnapper gets my blood up!”
Mr. Krumm asserted after the milk wagon had
vanished around a curve. “I wouldn’t have ordered
him to keep off the property, only he’s become a
pest.”</p>

<p>“I take it, you don’t consider the cave safe?”
Judy inquired curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s safe enough, if you don’t wander in too
far,” the real estate man replied with a shrug. “My
order doesn’t apply to you folks. If you want to see
the cave, you can go down there any time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d care to explore,” Ardeth said
with a shiver. “Not after learning that a man died
in the cave.”</p>

<p>“Bart told you about <em>that</em>, I suppose?” Mr.
Krumm questioned sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
“Bart didn’t tell you <em>why</em> the man lost his life,”
Mr. Krumm said, without answering the inquiry.
“No, he just filled you up with a lot of nonsense
about a White Witch.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t really cast a spell over the cottage?”
Judy asked mischievously.</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm’s normally florid face became even
redder. He sucked in his breath, moistened his lips,
and then launched into another vehement denial
that anything was wrong with Calico Cottage.</p>

<p>“I’m sick of all this gossipy talk!” he ended his
tirade. “I’m sick of losing tenants! I’m so weary of
it, that I’m willing to pay good money to disprove
all the contemptible stories.”</p>

<p>The Scouts remained respectfully silent.</p>

<p>“Bart has convinced you, I suppose, that you
should move out,” Mr. Krumm went on. Without
giving anyone an opportunity to deny the statement,
he continued: “All right, suppose I admit
that former tenants have complained about the
cottage having strange noises at night? There must
be an explanation for it&mdash;a logical, sensible one.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go along with you on that theory,” Miss
Ward replied. “You have a proposition, Mr.
Krumm?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. It’s all bunk about Calico Cave or
the cottage having a ghost. If you’ll stay here for
two weeks, and disprove the story, I’ll refund your
rent payment. What d’you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Ardeth, Virginia and Judy gazed questioningly at
their leader, awaiting her decision.</p>

<p>“We would prefer a rent refund with no strings
attached,” the teacher suggested.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I can’t do that. After all, I’m not in business
for my health. This cottage has been an expensive
proposition. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“We’ll consider your offer,” Miss Ward said
quietly. “We’ll remain for another night and make
our decision after that. However, if we do make
the test, it will not be for commercial reasons, but
only to safeguard Judy’s aunt.”</p>

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a><i>Chapter 7</i><br />
<span>THE TREASURE BOX</span></h2>

<p class="noi">PINE Cone Camp seemed strangely deserted when
Miss Ward, Ardeth, Judy and Virginia arrived there
at nine o’clock in the station wagon.</p>

<p>Seeking the tent which had been assigned to the
Beaver Patrol unit, the new arrivals found it quite
deserted.</p>

<p>“Where is everyone?” Ardeth asked in perplexity.
“Surely not on a hike so early?”</p>

<p>Swimming suits hung on the clothes lines, attesting
to the fact that the campers already had
enjoyed an early morning plunge in Morning Glory
Lake.</p>

<p>“Look!” Judy suddenly cried, pointing toward a
cleared area some distance away at the edge of the
forest. “Everyone is over there! Let’s see what’s
doing.”</p>

<p>Hurrying over to the group, the girls could not
at first discern what it was that had drawn the interest
of the entire camp.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, they edged deeper into the
assembly and saw that the other Scouts were taking
turns peering into a large wooden box, covered with
a wire screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
“What in the world?” Virginia speculated.</p>

<p>Just then Beverly, Kathleen and Betty caught
sight of their patrol mates in the crowd, and joined
them. Judy asked the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, you girls have missed all the fun, being
stuck down there at Calico Cottage,” Kathleen told
her. “We’ve started a treasure box.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Look in it and you’ll see!”</p>

<p>The other Scouts moved aside to make way for
Judy and the newcomers. Gazing into the box, they
were amazed to see all manner of strange animals
and insects.</p>

<p>“It’s a nature treasure chest!” Kathleen informed
her friends. “We already have a mouse, a spider,
and three varieties of turtles. Each patrol is supposed
to contribute an animal, bird or unusual
insect.”</p>

<p>“Does Beaver Patrol have an entry?” Judy asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Beverly very nearly caught a little chipmunk,
but he eluded her. We’re depending upon
you girls to help us.”</p>

<p>“We will,” Ardeth promised. “Just give us time
to get our thoughts adjusted, and we’ll come up with
a prize winner.”</p>

<p>“There are to be no duplications,” Kathleen
warned. “All the patrols are working on it, so we’ll
have to get busy.”</p>

<p>“How about a little garter snake?” suggested
Ardeth thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“If Beaver Patrol goes for that, you’ll have to
produce the snake,” Kathleen replied with a shudder.
“No snakes for me!”</p>

<p>“I vote we put Ardeth in charge of finding a
patrol entry for the treasure box,” proposed Betty
Bache, who had joined the other girls. “She’ll get
a big boot out of the job.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to take it over,” Ardeth offered, for
she thoroughly enjoyed the study of nature and
had no fear of animals or insects.</p>

<p>“Good!” Kathleen approved. “That takes a load
off my mind.”</p>

<p>The blowing of a bugle summoned all the campers
to assembly. Miss Lubell waited until all the
Scouts had gathered, and then signalled for silence.
It was evident that she had a most important announcement.</p>

<p>“Girls,” she began, “we had planned a hike to
Indian Falls this morning, but it will be necessary
to make a change.”</p>

<p>A chorus of groans met this announcement, for
the girls had looked forward to the outing and outdoor
cookery.</p>

<p>“However, we have other interesting plans,” the
director went on quickly. “The Civil Air Patrol has
notified me that it can make a plane available for
the first-aid and exploration excursion I mentioned
earlier. But today is the only time the Service will
be able to cooperate. Accordingly, we’ve decided
to go ahead. All patrols desiring to compete, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
sign up at once. Your counselors will provide full
details.”</p>

<p>The girls were informed that at ten o’clock all
competing patrols would hike a quarter of a mile to
Flat Top, an area relatively level and clear of trees.</p>

<p>According to the plan, a Civil Air Patrol plane
would fly over the section to drop a message which
would give Scouts notification of a fake plane
crash. The general location of the accident likewise
would be given. Starting with equal information,
the units were expected to separate and compete
in trying to be the first to reach the designated
locality.</p>

<p>Once there, the Scouts were to give first aid
treatment to the imaginary victims, and proceed
exactly as if the accident were a real one. Three
girls from the Garden City Patrol had volunteered
to act as the injured passengers of the plane crash.
Notes would be pinned to their clothing, stating
the nature of their supposed injuries.</p>

<p>Kathleen, Judy, Betty and Beverly teamed up
as one exploring unit, representing Beaver Patrol.
Ardeth and Virginia decided not to enter the competition,
preferring to remain behind to search for
a suitable wild pet to add to the treasure box collection.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o’clock, the representatives of
seven patrols were encamped on the table top,
anxiously scanning the sky for a glimpse of the
expected plane. All the girls had dressed sensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
in heavy shirts, slacks and stout climbing boots.
Faces and necks were protected from the sun, but
even so, the rays bore fiercely down upon their
backs as they sat impatiently waiting.</p>

<p>“Won’t that plane ever come?” Beverly fretted,
wiping perspiration from her neck. “We’ve been
here an age now!”</p>

<p>“Only ten minutes,” Kathleen corrected.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems a year. Maybe there’s been a mix-up
about plans,” Beverly went on. “I wish I’d stayed
in camp. This trip will be hard and tiring.”</p>

<p>“Good experience though,” Judy said, continuing
to scan the azure, almost cloudless sky. “It will be
a test of skill to find our way to the right place,
administer first aid, make improvised litters and
carry our victims to help.”</p>

<p>“I hope we’re the first to get there,” Kathleen
declared. “So far, Beaver Patrol hasn’t shown up too
well in the camp competitions. That’s because all
of the girls haven’t been together, especially in the
evening. This is our chance.”</p>

<p>Judy suddenly sprang to her feet. She had been
the first in the group to sight the Civil Air Patrol
plane winging in from the east.</p>

<p>“Here it comes!” she cried. “They’ll be dropping
a message in a moment. Watch sharp!”</p>

<p>All of the patrols now were alert and ready. The
Scouts who had equipped themselves with field
glasses, trained them on the approaching plane.</p>

<p>Its wings flashing in the sunlight, the ship came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in low enough for the girls to see the forms of the
pilot and his passenger. Three times the plane
circled the tableland. Then on the fourth trip over,
the message tube was dropped.</p>

<p>It missed the open table top by twenty feet,
landing amid the trees and brush just below where
the Beaver Patrol girls had taken their stand.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Judy shouted, starting off at a run.
“I saw where it dropped!”</p>

<p>There was a mad scramble to see who would be
the first to reach the message tube. According to the
rules of the competition, the directions, once read,
could not be kept, but must be left behind for other
patrols.</p>

<p>Plunging through the underbrush, Judy was the
first to seize upon the shining metal tube. As she
opened it to remove the message which had been
folded within, Beverly, Kathleen and Betty crowded
close to read the directions.</p>

<p>“Plane crash at 9:48 a.m. on Hermit’s Ridge,”
Kathleen discerned the writing. “Three passengers
in need of help.”</p>

<p>“Hermit’s Ridge!” Beverly explained. “Where is
that?”</p>

<p>Judy already was consulting her map of the
region.</p>

<p>“You might know it’s a difficult climb from here!”
she exclaimed. “We have several choices of a
route. We can take the short, hard climb&mdash;no trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
That way, it looks to be approximately a mile and
a half from here.”</p>

<p>“What are the other choices?” Kathleen questioned.</p>

<p>“We can follow the main highway three quarters
of the way, and then make a short climb on Lone
Pine Trail. Our third choice is to descend from here
to Rocky Point Path and keep on it all the way.”</p>

<p>“I’m for taking the shortest route even if it will
mean a harder climb,” Beverly said at once. “Let’s
go!”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Judy directed, continuing to study the
map. “I’m in favor of the road myself. It may be
longer, but it’s a lot faster, easier walking most of
the way.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore, we may be able to catch a ride
part of the distance,” Kathleen added. “That would
be within the rules. The patrol wins that gets first
to Hermit’s Ridge and accomplishes its first aid
mission.”</p>

<p>“I’m in favor of the road too,” Betty Bache asserted,
siding with Kathleen and Judy. “The various
choice of routes is a test of judgment as well as
endurance.”</p>

<p>Leaving the message for the other patrols to read,
the four girls quickly descended rugged terrain
to the paved highway.</p>

<p>“I think we’re making a mistake,” Beverly insisted,
shifting her first-aid kit to a more comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
carrying position. “Not many cars pass on the road
at this time of day. The distance is much longer.”</p>

<p>“We can dog-trot part of it,” Judy said, beginning
to lope along. “Anyway, we’re well out ahead of the
others!”</p>

<p>“I can see another group starting out,” Beverly
reported looking back. “They chose the short, hard
way.”</p>

<p>“Since we’re out ahead, that might be their only
chance to beat us,” Betty reasoned. “I still think
we chose the better, faster route.”</p>

<p>Alternately, the girls dog-trotted twenty steps
and then walked the same number. In that manner,
they did not tire so easily or lose breath.</p>

<p>The road wound on through the forest in dips
and sharp ascents. They kept going, ignoring the
heat of the sun and their own increasing weariness.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we didn’t take the hard climb,” Judy
commented as she and Kathleen paused a moment
to wait for Betty and Beverly to catch up. “The
going will be tough enough before we reach Hermit’s
Ridge.”</p>

<p>At the next sharp bend in the highway, the Scouts
were able to look down at the table top some distance
below. Not a single patrol seemed to have
followed them.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” Beverly exclaimed. “All the others
have taken the shorter routes!”</p>

<p>“Let them,” Judy replied cheerfully. “It hasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
been proven yet that our judgment was poor. We’ve
been making fast time.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t caught that ride yet,” Beverly reminded
her. “Not a single car has passed us on the
road. And we’ve met only one truck.”</p>

<p>Resting only momentarily, the four went on,
doggedly determined to be the first to reach Hermit’s
Ridge. Soon they lost all view of their competitors
who had been swallowed up by the dense forest
foliage.</p>

<p>“Say, I think I hear a truck coming now!” Betty
presently exclaimed. She paused to cock an attentive
ear. “Wow! It’s coming fast, burning up the
road!”</p>

<p>“We’ll never flag down that driver!” Judy exclaimed,
moving hastily off the pavement.</p>

<p>The heavy freight carrier roared past the girls,
its massive tires screaming as it went around a
bend.</p>

<p>“What does that driver think this road is&mdash;a
speedway?” Beverly demanded. “Why, it’s dangerous&mdash;”</p>

<p>The four hikers halted abruptly, frozen by the
fearful sound of screeching brakes. They could not
see beyond the next sharp curve, but the sickening
thud was unmistakable. The speeding truck had
missed its turn and had skidded off the road!</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a><i>Chapter 8</i><br />
<span>VALUABLE CARGO</span></h2>


<p class="noi">ROUNDING the bend at a run, the four Scouts saw
that the big truck had missed plunging over the
ravine by mere inches.</p>

<p>The heavily loaded vehicle had skidded wildly,
bringing up at a sharp angle against a rocky embankment.
Shattered glass lay on the pavement.</p>

<p>Judy was the first to reach the tilted truck cab.
She could not at first get the jammed door open, but
suddenly it gave, swinging back so hard, she nearly
was thrown off balance.</p>

<p>The driver was slumped over the wheel, stunned
and bleeding from flesh cuts. He was a heavy-set
man with a beak-like nose and square jaw which
sagged to give him a stupid appearance. His eyes
were glazed and unseeing.</p>

<p>The only other occupant of the truck, a thin man
with two front teeth missing, sprawled half off the
seat, moaning and using foul language.</p>

<p>“My neck!” he screamed. “It’s like killing me!
Don’t stand there! Do something! Get a doctor!”</p>

<p>He pulled himself out of the cab, pushing angrily
at Kathleen when she tried to help him. Despite the
rebuff she took his arm to steady him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“Don’t touch me! Get away!” he screamed, staggering.
Kathleen caught a whiff of his breath then
and knew that he had been drinking. She noted that
his right arm hung limp and that the right shoulder
was much lower than the left. He had grasped it
at the elbow to provide support.</p>

<p>“You can’t raise your arm above your shoulder,
can you?” she demanded. “Your collar bone must be
fractured.”</p>

<p>“So what?” the trucker demanded savagely. He
leaned weakly against the truck, ignoring her efforts
to be of help.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Judy, Beverly and Betty had devoted
their attention to the truck driver, who appeared in
more serious condition than the disagreeable passenger.</p>

<p>Carefully, they stretched him out flat on the cab
seat.</p>

<p>“He may be only stunned,” Judy said anxiously.
“The first thing is to get the blood stopped. No artery
has been cut fortunately.”</p>

<p>The blood came from two facial cuts and a wrist
which had been slashed by flying glass. Judy removed
a tiny splinter of glass from the latter wound,
treated the cut with antiseptic, placed a compress
over the opening and bandaged it tightly.</p>

<p>That job done, the girls bandaged the driver’s
face, noting with relief that he seemed to be recovering
from shock. Now and then he moaned in pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
as they worked deftly and efficiently, but for the
most part he eyed them silently.</p>

<p>Kathleen, on the other hand, was having a most
trying time with her patient, who refused to cooperate.
He would not lie down or let her examine
his neck.</p>

<p>“I can’t do anything with him,” she whispered
to Judy. “I’m sure he has a fractured collar bone.
But what to do about it? He’s acting like a maniac.”</p>

<p>“Delirious?”</p>

<p>“He’s just a mean character,” Kathleen muttered
in an undertone. “I’m sort of scared.”</p>

<p>“Scared? Why?”</p>

<p>“He has a revolver in his back pocket.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he carries it to protect the cargo,” Judy
replied. “Let’s see what we can do about that collar
bone.”</p>

<p>Moving over to the sullen trucker, who stood
leaning against the tilted vehicle, she addressed him
quietly but firmly.</p>

<p>“You’ll feel more comfortable if you sit or lie
down. We’ll help you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any help.” The trucker’s lips parted
in an ugly snarl which revealed his missing front
teeth. “You got a car?”</p>

<p>“No, we’re Girl Scouts on a hike.”</p>

<p>“Girl Scouts! A lot of help you’ll be!”</p>

<p>Judy ignored the sarcasm, noting how limply the
trucker’s right arm hung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
“We can help,” she insisted. “Your collar bone has
been broken, I think.”</p>

<p>“So what?” the trucker demanded belligerently.
“I’m worried about this truck. We can never move
it out of this&mdash;have to abandon it.”</p>

<p>“You should be able to get a wrecker from the
village. Now about that collar bone&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Forget it, I said.” The man’s gaze roved toward
the cab of the truck where Betty and Beverly were
covering the driver with coats.</p>

<p>“Is Joe done for?” he demanded with cold rather
than friendly concern.</p>

<p>“He’s more stunned than hurt, I think,” Judy
replied.</p>

<p>“Can’t he make it on his own pins? We gotta get
out o’ here.”</p>

<p>“He shouldn’t try to walk. We’ll bring help to
you as fast as we can. First, though, you must take
a sensible attitude and let us wrap that collar bone.
You’ll be far more comfortable until we can get you
a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” the trucker suddenly consented. “Make
it snappy though, and don’t hurt me or I’ll bash
you in! I ain’t in no mood to be worked over by
amateurs.”</p>

<p>Having cajoled the man into a more cooperative
mood, Judy went quickly to work. With Kathleen
helping, she utilized a triangular bandage as a sling
for the right arm, tying it snugly to the side of his
body with a cravat bandage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
“Humph!” the trucker muttered, not displeased
as he surveyed the finished job. “Not too bad.”</p>

<p>“The important thing now is to get you both to
a doctor,” Judy said briskly. “Cars pass rather infrequently
on this road. Kathleen and I will go for
help while Beverly and Betty stay here to do what
they can.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done enough now,” the trucker returned.
“Thanks, kids! Now all of you beat it&mdash;on your way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a wrecker sent,” Judy went on, gathering
up her first aid equipment.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother.”</p>

<p>“But we’ll be glad to do it,” Judy insisted. “It’s
part of our Scout training to help when we can.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Cut out the chatter and clear out!” The
trucker glowered at the girls, and dropped his left
hand to his hip pocket. “Get out I said!”</p>

<p>Frightened by the hostile attitude of the man,
Beverly and Betty snatched up their first aid kits,
and started hurriedly off the way they had come.
Kathleen and Judy were more deliberate in making
their departure. However, knowing that the trucker
had a revolver, they were in no mood to argue with
him.</p>

<p>Once beyond the first bend in the road, the four
girls excitedly discussed the situation.</p>

<p>“That’s all the thanks we get for helping!” Beverly
said furiously. “We’ve lost out on the Hermit
Ridge competition too&mdash;worse luck.”</p>

<p>“I guess there’s more to this first aid business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
than just wrapping up broken bones!” Betty added.
“One has to learn how to handle half-crazy patients.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why that man was so eager to
get us away,” Judy remarked thoughtfully. “Normally,
anyone in similar plight would welcome help.
Why wouldn’t he want us to send a doctor or a
wrecker?”</p>

<p>“Just out of his head, I guess,” Beverly shrugged.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” Judy insisted, “he seemed
quite cool about the entire procedure. You know,
I wonder what sort of cargo those men were carrying?”</p>

<p>“It must have been valuable,” Kathleen replied.
“Otherwise, why would he carry a revolver for
protection?”</p>

<p>Keyed up by the encounter with the two men,
but decidedly discouraged over the outcome of their
efforts, the girls hiked as fast as they could down
the mountain road. Despite the order that they
were not to send help, they planned to do so.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t a car ever come on this road?” Beverly
complained after they had hiked ten minutes without
meeting or being passed by an automobile or
a truck.</p>

<p>“I see a car coming now!” Kathleen suddenly
cried. “From the direction of the village.”</p>

<p>“Say, we’re in luck!” exclaimed Judy, abruptly
halting. “It’s a state highway patrol car!”</p>

<p>Waiting, the girls flagged the automobile to a
stop. Quickly, they told the two patrolmen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
accident and of the strange behavior of the truckers
who had rejected assistance.</p>

<p>“Did you notice the license number of the truck?”
one of the highway patrolmen asked.</p>

<p>None of the Scouts had made a note of it.</p>

<p>“We were too busy wrapping up wounds to think
of that,” Judy confessed.</p>

<p>The patrolmen next inquired if the girls could
describe the two truckers.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Kathleen said eagerly. “The passenger
was a thin fellow with two teeth missing. He had
dark bushy eyebrows and was very disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“That was Ben Vodner, I’ll bet a cent!” one of
the patrolmen exclaimed. “Did he have a scar on
his left cheek?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did!” Judy recalled. “A long jagged white
mark!”</p>

<p>“What did the other man look like?”</p>

<p>“His most prominent feature was a large hooked
nose,” Judy described him. “He was a large man,
heavy-set and with a square jaw. I’d say he weighed
about two hundred pounds&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s Joe Pompilli for sure!”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Kathleen demanded.</p>

<p>“Joe’s the ring leader of a bunch of hi-jackers,”
one of the patrolmen informed her. “Off and on
for the last six months, he and his boys have been
hi-jacking cargo and taking it through here right
under the noses of the forest rangers.”</p>

<p>“So that was why they didn’t want help!” Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
exclaimed. “That truck that went off the road was
loaded with stolen cargo!”</p>

<p>Taking the girls into the patrol car, the two patrolmen
proceeded with all speed toward the scene
of the accident.</p>

<p>“It’s just around the next bend,” Judy informed
the driver.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll let you girls out here,” he said, pulling
up at the side of the road. “There may be shooting.
Stay back until we see what’s what.”</p>

<p>Piling out of the car, the Scouts waited until the
patrolmen had driven on. Then, they rounded the
bend, tense and expectant.</p>

<p>The truck remained in the ditch where last they
had seen it, but neither of the injured men were
anywhere visible.</p>

<p>Watching from a safe distance, the girls saw the
patrolmen carefully search the truck cab.</p>

<p>“Those two hi-jackers have fled!” Judy exclaimed.
“I guess they weren’t as badly hurt as we thought!”</p>

<p>At a run, the Scouts raced up the road to join the
patrolmen, who by this time had broken open the
door lock on the back of the truck.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” one of the searchers declared
as he swung open the double doors. “Stolen auto
tires!”</p>

<p>“Tires snatched from the Graystone Transport
Co. The truck was held up early this morning across
the state line.”</p>

<p>Judy and her friends were bewildered with respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
to what had happened to the two accident victims.
They were not long in doubt however, for
tire marks on the pavement showed plainly that a
car had come along, turned on the roadway, and
returned in the same direction whence it had come.</p>

<p>“Ben Vodner must have stopped the driver and
made him take him and his pal, Joe, to town,” the
patrolman commented. “They’re likely heading for
Brady City, over the state line. There’s a slim
chance we can overtake ’em.”</p>

<p>Knowing that the wild chase might end in a gun
battle, the patrolmen told the Scouts they could
not take them along.</p>

<p>“Catch a ride back to your camp,” one of the men
advised Judy as he prepared to drive away. “We’ll
let you know later how this comes out. If we overtake
those hi-jackers, we may need you to testify.
If they get away, you want to steer clear of them.
Joe and Ben are mighty tough boys, and they’ll
bear you no gratitude for the help you gave them
today!”</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a><i>Chapter 9</i><br />
<span>“IS JOE THERE?”</span></h2>

<p class="noi">ALL that day, Pine Cone Camp buzzed with the
exciting story of how the four Beaver Patrol Scouts
had given first aid to the two notorious hi-jackers.</p>

<p>Judy, Beverly, Betty and Kathleen were subjected
to a great deal of teasing. The other campers, to
plague them declared that their timely assistance
had made it easier for the truckers to escape.</p>

<p>That the two men had made a successful getaway
was confirmed late in the afternoon. Two state
highway patrolmen, Clinton DeWitt and George
Franey, dropped around at Pine Cone Camp purposely
to inform Judy and her friends that the identity
of the hi-jackers tentatively had been established.</p>

<p>“We’re quite sure those two truckers were Joe
Pompilli and Ben Vodner,” the girls were told.
“They stopped a car and made the driver give them
a lift. At gun point, they forced him to take them
across the state line. Finally, on a side road, miles
from a telephone, they abandoned the driver and
continued on their way.”</p>

<p>“Joe and his pal probably will give this area a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
wide berth for awhile,” the other patrolman added.
“You never can tell though.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed George Franey. “They’re
daring outlaws, well organized. Joe Pompilli won’t
abandon this run because of one mishap. But we’ll
be watching for him!”</p>

<p>As was to be expected, Judy, Beverly, Betty and
Kathleen, were regarded somewhat as heroines by
their camp mates. Many times they were called
upon to recite their adventures on the lonely mountain
road.</p>

<p>“We’ve given a bandage-by-bandage report so
many times I’m beginning to embellish the details,”
Judy laughed as she told the story for perhaps the
twelfth time. “That thin fellow the patrolmen called
Ben was a mean sort of individual. He didn’t actually
threaten us with his gun though.”</p>

<p>“The worst of it was that we lost out in the Hermit
Ridge competition,” added Kathleen ruefully.
“I’m afraid we’ll have to depend on Ardeth and
Virginia to win points for our patrol.”</p>

<p>She smiled at the other two, who had spent most
of the morning searching for a suitable specimen to
add to the nature treasure chest.</p>

<p>Both girls were sunburned and discouraged. True,
they had captured an unwary bull frog and a
rare type of water insect, but only to learn that
other units had made similar entries during their
absence from camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
“So now to qualify, we’ll have to find something
different,” Ardeth asserted. “I’m sick about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get an entry before the deadline,”
Judy said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“We have several days to work on it,” added
Kathleen.</p>

<p>“The other campers have combed the lake and
the area around here so thoroughly that it will be
hard to find anything unusual,” Ardeth insisted with
a shake of her head. “All of the common things such
as worms, bugs, and bees, have been used too!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find an entry while we’re at
Calico Cottage,” Kathleen suggested. “The woods
near the cave haven’t been explored.”</p>

<p>“We might enter the Cottage ghost!” Judy said
with a chuckle. “If we could capture him, we’d be
entitled to first prize!”</p>

<p>“By the way, have you heard from your aunt?”
Ardeth inquired.</p>

<p>Judy nodded and displayed a telegram which she
carried in her pocket. “This came in the morning
delivery from town,” she explained. “Aunt Mattie
will arrive on the 2:10 p.m. train tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Have you told her about the cottage having a
ghost?”</p>

<p>“No, and I’m not eager to either,” Judy returned
with a grimace. “Aunt Mattie might make a dreadful
fuss. I wish we could clear up the mystery
before she gets here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
“We have tonight to work on it,” Kathleen remarked
thoughtfully. “If only we could get down
into the cottage basement! It wouldn’t do though,
to break the door lock.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” Judy agreed. “Mr. Krumm would have
a just complaint then!”</p>

<p>Though the Beaver Patrol girls made light of the
“ghost” and the strange flute music which had disturbed
their slumbers at the cottage, they were
determined to find a logical explanation for the occurrence.</p>

<p>Judy and her friends had said very little about
the mysterious happening, but the story had leaked
out and greatly enlarged in the telling. Throughout
the afternoon, the girls were besieged by questions.
Their rivals in the Lone Tree unit seemed especially
interested.</p>

<p>“We’re certainly the target of attention,” Judy
remarked to Kathleen. “I can’t understand why the
Lone Tree girls are so fascinated by every detail.
Something’s in the wind!”</p>

<p>The Beaver Patrol members remained at camp
for dinner and to enjoy a ceremonial camp fire
which wound up with the telling of ghost stories.
At nine o’clock, the station wagon took Judy, Kathleen,
Miss Ward, Ardeth and Virginia to Calico
Cottage for the night.</p>

<p>“We’ll have our tent by tomorrow, I’m quite sure,”
Miss Ward told the girls as they let themselves into
the dark cottage. “That will be a relief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
“I don’t mind being here,” Virginia asserted. “In
fact, I think it’s exciting! Do you suppose we’ll hear
that flute player tonight?”</p>

<p>“We will if we keep dwelling upon it,” Miss
Ward replied as she switched on the lights. “The
mind, you know, plays strange tricks. Now everyone
to bed, and no nonsense.”</p>

<p>Rather soberly, the girls went to their rooms.
Because Miss Ward was with them, they had no
fear of spending a night in the cottage. Nevertheless,
they were somewhat tense with expectancy.</p>

<p>Ardeth was removing a shoe, when suddenly she
stiffened. “Listen!” she directed. “What was that?”</p>

<p>“I heard nothing,” returned Virginia.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a thumping sound in the cellar,”
Ardeth insisted in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>“That was your own heart pounding, goose!”
teased Kathleen. “Jump into bed, and stop imagining
things.”</p>

<p>Ardeth obediently turned off the bedroom light.
Going to the window, she opened it, and stood for
a moment, gazing toward the dark forest which
edged ominously close to the cottage lawn.</p>

<p>“Kathleen! Virginia!” she summoned the others,
drawing in her breath.</p>

<p>“Now what?” Kathleen demanded.</p>

<p><a name="come" id="come"></a>“Come here, quick! Tell me what you see.” Dramatically,
Ardeth pointed toward the towering trees.</p>

<p>Virginia went quickly to the window, peering in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the direction indicated. She stood silent and tense,
scarcely believing her own eyesight.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s something white, and it moves!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Kathleen had joined the other two. Ardeth gripped
her hand so tightly it hurt. “I’m scared,” she
confessed shakily. “What do you think, Kathy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll call Miss Ward and Judy.”</p>

<p>Quickly, she summoned the other two from the
next bedroom. Neither had started to disrobe for
the night. For several minutes the five stood at the
darkened window, gazing out across the sloping
lawn to the dark backdrop of trees.</p>

<p>Plainly they could see a white object moving
lazily back and forth against a curtain of foliage.
A nearly full moon added to the eerie effect, casting
a ghostly light over the lonely forest area.</p>

<p>“A spook!” Ardeth declared shakily. “It’s coming
this way too!”</p>

<p>“No such thing,” Miss Ward corrected in a firm
voice. “Whatever the object may be, it is not moving
in this direction. I’ll get my flashlight and investigate.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” Judy offered.</p>

<p>Putting on warm jackets, the two slipped out of
the cottage. The night was chilly, for a light breeze
blew from the direction of the river.</p>

<p>Judy and the teacher focused their eyes on the
white object at the edge of the woods. Though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
continued to move lazily, its basic position did not
seem to change.</p>

<p>“Keep well behind me, Judy,” Miss Ward directed
as they drew near the trees. “I doubt that
there is any serious cause for alarm, but it’s wise to
proceed cautiously.”</p>

<p>Having decided upon a bold approach, the pair
moved directly toward the white object.</p>

<p>When they were within a few yards of it, Miss
Ward switched on the flashlight. She directed the
beam squarely upon the fluttering “ghost.”</p>

<p>“Why, it looks like a bed sheet!” Judy exclaimed,
and burst into relieved laughter.</p>

<p>“A sheet attached to a bush!” added Miss Ward.
“Let’s find out about this.”</p>

<p>She held the light while Judy removed the sheet
from the foliage. To prevent it from blowing away,
two ends had been tied to the branches with cord.</p>

<p>“This ‘ghost’ was put here purposely!” Judy declared.
“By whom, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Any marking on the linen?”</p>

<p>Judy inspected the sheet under the light. “Here
are some initials stamped on the edge!” she exclaimed.
“‘P.C.C.’”</p>

<p>“Pine Cone Camp!”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t a good joke on us!” Judy
laughed. “The girls at camp decided to produce
that ghost we were telling them about! Beverly
and Betty may have pulled this one!”</p>

<p>“They were in camp all afternoon, Judy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“That’s true. Maybe some of the Lone Tree Scouts
did it then! One of their girls has been asking a
lot of questions about Calico Cottage.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind a bit of good fun,” Miss Ward said,
folding the sheet. “On the other hand, I’m not in
favor of making too much of this ghost talk. I think
I’ll discuss the matter with Miss Lubell tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope whoever played the trick won’t get into
trouble. I’m sure it was all in good fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no one will receive a reprimand,” Miss
Ward promised. “I’ll find out which girls had camp
leave this afternoon. If it develops that any of them
played the trick, I’ll ask them not to repeat it, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>When the two returned to the cottage with the
bed sheet, Virginia, Ardeth and Kathleen anxiously
met them at the door.</p>

<p>“Here’s your ghost!” Judy laughed, tossing the
camp linen into Kathleen’s arms. “Look at the initials!”</p>

<p>“So that’s why those Lone Tree Scouts were giggling
and carrying on this afternoon!” Kathleen exclaimed
after she had examined the markings. “Several
of them asked for camp leave too!”</p>

<p>“Then my idea about that probably was right,”
Miss Ward said.</p>

<p>Greatly relieved that the ghost scare had no serious
aspects, the Scouts discussed the prank for a
few minutes, and then went to bed. It was a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
while, however, before the house finally settled
down.</p>

<p>Judy fell quickly asleep. How long she slumbered
she had no way of knowing. But suddenly, she
found herself wide awake.</p>

<p>Miss Ward, she noted, was sleeping soundly beside
her.</p>

<p>Wondering what had disturbed her, Judy sat up.
Moonlight streamed into the bedroom. She judged
that it could not be later than midnight or possibly
one o’clock.</p>

<p>The telephone was ringing.</p>

<p>“So that’s what awakened me!” Judy thought,
leaping out of bed. “Wonder who can be calling
at this time of night?”</p>

<p>The phone call, she thought, might be from Pine
Cone Camp. Something might have happened to
Betty or Beverly. Or possibly it was a message from
Aunt Mattie.</p>

<p>In her haste to reach the telephone before it
stopped ringing, Judy bumped against a chair. Nursing
a bruised knee, she hobbled on.</p>

<p>As she took down the receiver to say “hello,”
a gruff voice came over the line.</p>

<p>“Time you answered! Is Joe there?”</p>

<p>“Joe?” faltered Judy. “Joe who?”</p>

<p>Only silence gave reply. Then the wire went
completely dead. The speaker at the other end of
the line had hung up.</p>

<span>A MIDNIGHT DISTURBANCE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">AS Judy hung up the telephone receiver, the light
suddenly was switched on behind her. Startled, she
whirled around with a smothered exclamation of
alarm.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to frighten you, Judy.” It was
Kathleen who stood in the doorway, a corduroy
robe flung over her shoulders. “I heard someone
moving around, and thought I’d check, that’s all.
Is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“The phone was ringing. I&mdash;I don’t know what to
make of it.”</p>

<p>“Who was it that called, Judy?”</p>

<p>“That’s the point. I don’t know. Someone asked
for Joe.”</p>

<p>“Joe? Joe who?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I asked, Kathleen. The only
Joe I know is that dreadful Joe Pompilli.”</p>

<p>“Someone must have called the wrong number.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Judy admitted doubtfully. “It gave
me an ugly start though. What time is it?”</p>

<p>“A little past midnight,” Kathleen said, looking
at her wristwatch. “What a night! All we need to
make it complete is a little flute music!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
The switching on of a light had disturbed the
others in the cottage. Miss Ward came in from the
bedroom and then Virginia and Ardeth, the latter
groggy with sleep.</p>

<p>“What now?” she mumbled. “Another ghost?”</p>

<p>Judy explained about the telephone.</p>

<p>“Those Lone Tree Scouts!” Virginia exclaimed
indignantly. “They’re playing another joke on us!
Trying to pretend that Joe Pompilli is calling!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anyone from Pine Cone Camp,” Judy
said, her face serious. “Whoever called was a man.”</p>

<p>“It must have been someone who dialed a wrong
number,” Kathleen insisted. “I’m in favor of forgetting
the whole business, and going to bed. If
we don’t get some sleep we’ll all be wrecks tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s sound advice,” approved Miss Ward. “To
bed everyone!”</p>

<p>All the girls were up at seven o’clock the next
morning, feeling little the worse for the excitement
of the night. While the Scouts were washing the
breakfast dishes, the telephone rang again.</p>

<p>“You get it, Judy,” Virginia directed with a giggle.
“It’s probably from Joe.”</p>

<p>“From Aunt Mattie more than likely,” Judy replied,
moving hastily to the telephone.</p>

<p>The message was from Miss Lubell at Pine Cone
Camp. She asked Judy to tell Miss Ward that the
station wagon driver had been delayed that morning
and could not call for the girls until ten thirty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
“This means we’ll have considerable free time on
our hands,” Judy remarked as she relayed the information
to the others.</p>

<p>“Let’s explore the river area, and maybe around
the cave,” proposed Ardeth. “I want to find an
insect or an animal we can enter in the nature treasure
chest.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” Miss Ward decided.</p>

<p>The work already had been finished. Locking the
cottage, the five struck off down the private road.
After it dead-ended, they went on across the silvery-gray
rocks and through a stretch of sand to the
river.</p>

<p>Beyond the ribbon of blue water, the mountains
rose in jagged green peaks. A ranger station was
visible on one of the high slopes, set in a cleared
area among the trees.</p>

<p>A half-rotted dock extended for some distance
out into the stream. The girls noticed an elderly
man in blue overalls tying up his rowboat after a
fishing expedition.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” Judy said pleasantly as the girls
wandered over. “How’s the fishing?”</p>

<p>Straightening up, the old man shoved a soiled
white cap at a rakish angle over his shaggy white
hair.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ to you,” he greeted the girls jovially.
“The fishin’? Nary a bite! Blast my timbers, it’s a
waste of a man’s time to blister his skin out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
sun on this old river. I’m slingin’ my hook for today.”</p>

<p>Moving stiffly, the elderly man began to unload
his fishing equipment from the boat. Judy and
Kathleen reached down to help him.</p>

<p>“Right handy mates ye be,” he remarked, well
pleased by their attention. “Don’t recollect seein’
you gals hereabouts before. Tourists?”</p>

<p>“We’re Girl Scouts,” Judy explained. “We’re staying
at Pine Cone Camp. Because of a mix-up there
over reservations, some of us have been sleeping at
Calico Cottage.”</p>

<p>“Calico Cottage? Well, bash my binnacles!”</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely cottage,” Ardeth contributed. “The
only trouble is, it seems to have a ghost.”</p>

<p>“A musical ghost who plays a flute at night,”
added Virginia.</p>

<p>“You don’t say! A ghost!” The old man gave a
throaty chuckle and then laughed so hard that his
sizeable stomach rolled up and down under the
overalls. “I’ll be a son of a sea cook! That’s a good
joke on Krumm!”</p>

<p>“It’s not so much fun for us though,” Judy declared
earnestly. “We’re turning the cottage over
to my aunt this afternoon. She’s inclined to be nervous.
We’d hoped to clear up the mystery before she
arrived, but that seems out of the question now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste any time worrying about that ghost,”
the old man advised. “A bunch o’ Girl Scouts ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
to be smart enough to get to wind’ard of any flute-playin’
spook.”</p>

<p>“It would seem that way,” agreed Judy. “So far,
though, we’ve had no luck. By the way, you’re not
Captain Hager by any chance?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name, but not by chance! Captain
Humphrey Hager, formerly master of the good ship
<i>Elaine</i>. I’ve been in dry dock going on ten years
now.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to meet you,” Judy declared cordially.
She introduced Miss Ward and the girls, and
then added: “Bart Ranieau told us that you once
owned Calico Cottage&mdash;or rather, the old homestead
that stood on the same foundation.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Old Captain Hager agreed, his
leathery face wrinkling into a scowl. “I found myself
in low water, financially speaking. That blasted,
penny-squeezin’ Krumm kept pestering me, until
finally I sold him the place.”</p>

<p>“Tell us, Captain Hager,” urged Kathleen, “did
the house have a ghost when you lived there?”</p>

<p>A knowing smile overspread the old man’s face.
“Well, yes, and no,” he said. “I advised Krumm to
put in a new foundation, but he let me know he
would do it his own way. So now he has a ghost!
Ha!”</p>

<p>“Does the old foundation have anything to do
with the ghost?” Virginia asked, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>Old Captain Hager acted as if he had not heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the question. He fussed with the painter of the
rowboat for a moment, and then remarked offhand:</p>

<p>“So you gals have met Bart Ranieau? Now there’s
a fine lad, smart as a whip and with the courage of
a young lion. He told you about Hager’s Hole?”</p>

<p>“Calico Cave?” inquired Judy.</p>

<p>“Hager’s Hole,” the old man repeated. “I don’t
take stock of that new fancy name Krumm tacked
on. Bart told you about his father losing his life in
the cave?”</p>

<p>“Why no!” exclaimed Judy.</p>

<p>“He did say something about an explorer trying
to find the cave’s exit, and never being heard of
again,” Virginia added.</p>

<p>“That was Bart’s father,” the Captain informed
her. “His son’s a chip off the old block. Lots of sand
in the craw! Bart’s trying to work his way through
college by peddlin’ milk. Aye, he’s an up and
comer!”</p>

<p>“How did Bart’s father lose his life?” Miss Ward
inquired.</p>

<p>The old captain’s gaze swept the river and lifted
to fasten thoughtfully upon the dark entranceway
of Calico Cave.</p>

<p>“No one knows,” he replied. “Not for sure. Folks
say though, that it was the siphon that did for him.”</p>

<p>“What’s a siphon?” demanded Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Hager’s Hole has an underground river,” he related.
“Where it empties no one knows. Deep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the cave is a grotto, so beautiful it will blast your
eyes! The underground stream must have hollowed
it out ages ago, then bored its way on through the
rock.</p>

<p>“By wading waist-deep and finally neck-deep in
water one can follow the river for awhile. Then the
ceiling dips until water and roof meet. That’s your
siphon.”</p>

<p>“A stretch of water between the rocks, with no
roof space above?” Judy questioned.</p>

<p>“Aye.”</p>

<p>“Bart’s father tried to go through the siphon?”
Miss Ward inquired soberly.</p>

<p>“He knew he was risking his life, but spelunkers
don’t have good sense when it comes to explorin’
caves. Bart’s father was obsessed with the idea he
had to find the exit to Hager’s Hole. He gambled his
life, figuring he could dive through the siphon and
find an air space beyond.”</p>

<p>“No one ever learned for certain what became of
Mr. Ranieau?” The question was asked by Judy
who sat cross-legged on the dock, listening intently
to every word of the story.</p>

<p>“His clothes were found in the grotto, tied in a
neat bundle. That’s all that ever was known. A
watch was kept at the siphon for days, but there
never was a sound or a signal of any kind. That was
a long while ago, and now Bart’s sailin’ the same
course as his dad, hauntin’ that cave, and dreamin’
about it at night. I’m right worried about the lad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
“You’re afraid he’ll meet with mishap in the
cave?” questioned Miss Ward.</p>

<p>“Bart knows his way in that cavern like it was his
own ship,” the old captain replied. “What worries
me, Ma’am, is that he’s obsessed with finding out
what became of his father. He keeps talking about
the siphon, speculatin’ on whether a strong swimmer
couldn’t get through. One of these days he may
be rash enough to try it.”</p>

<p>“Calico Cave&mdash;Hager’s Hole, I mean,” Kathleen
corrected herself, “must be a fascinating place.
You’ve been in the cave many times I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Aye, in my younger day, I went there right
often.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have seen the White Witch!”
cried Judy, her brown eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“Aye,” Captain Hager agreed reminiscently.
“Aye.” He became absorbed in deep thought.</p>

<p>Judy broke into his meditation to ask how long it
would take to reach the formation after one left the
cave entrance.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes,” the captain estimated. “It’s easy
walkin’. But don’t you gals try it by yourself. If
you’re aimin’ to go into that cave, you need a
guide.”</p>

<p>“We do, indeed!” cried Judy. She sprang to her
feet, seizing the captain’s hand so unexpectedly that
he nearly dropped his pipe. “Oh, Captain Hager,
will you take us? Please, will you guide us to the
White Witch?”</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a><i>Chapter 11</i><br />
<span>SPELL OF THE CAVE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">CAPTAIN Hager’s remarks about the cave had
stirred the imagination of the Scouts, and even Miss
Ward thought it would be interesting to explore the
cavern for a short distance.</p>

<p>“Would it be safe, do you think?” she asked, as
Captain Hager seemed to be giving Judy’s request
sober consideration.</p>

<p>“It’s safe enough, Ma’am,” he assured her. “The
only danger lies in going too far without a guide.”</p>

<p>“No rock falls?”</p>

<p>“Never heard of one in all the years I’ve lived
hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Then do take us, Captain Hager!” Judy urged
again, prancing excitedly about the dock. “We
haven’t much time, because the camp station wagon
is to come for us at ten thirty. Please, could we start
right now?”</p>

<p>“Dash it, I was calculatin’ on anchorin’ for a comfortable
snooze,” the captain complained good-naturedly.
“But if them’s my sailing orders, we’ll
cast off for the cave!”</p>

<p>The old man told the Scouts and their leader to
meet him at the entranceway of Hager’s Hole. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
promised to join them there as soon as he had gone
to his nearby river shack to leave his fishing equipment
and pick up a few items he would want for
the trip.</p>

<p>Taking leave of the old man, the girls swiftly
climbed the slope to the cave. Captain Hager did
not keep them waiting long.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes, they glimpsed his bent
figure coming along the path. He had changed his
shoes, put on a blue jacket, and carried a lantern.</p>

<p>Before leading the way into the cave, Captain
Hager told the group something of its history. The
cavern, he related, was known to have been in existence
in early Indian days&mdash;the exact date of its
origin never would be established.</p>

<p>“Now there are all types of caves,” he went on,
warming to his subject. “Tunnel caves, river system
caves, fissure caves&mdash;no two ever are the same, and
that’s what makes ’em so interesting to explorers.
This one starts with a sort of sinkhole entrance. It
narrows down for a distance and then opens up into
a chamber where you’ll see the White Witch. That’s
as far as most folks ever go.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take us too long to see the formation?”
Miss Ward asked, looking anxiously at her wrist
watch. “We haven’t much time.”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes, ma’am, to walk to the chamber.
The climb back will take longer. I’m not as spry as
I was in the old days.”</p>

<p>“We can spare an hour,” Miss Ward decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Captain Hager instructed the girls to follow him,
single-file. Miss Ward brought up the rear of the
procession to make certain that none of her charges
wandered out of line.</p>

<p>Cautiously, and with awe, the Scouts moved into
the entrance chamber of the cave. A considerable
current of air moved in the cavern, nearly lifting
Kathleen’s beret from her head.</p>

<p>The room in which the girls found themselves,
though dark, was neither damp nor musty. By the
light of Captain Hager’s lantern, they distinguished
smoke-blackened limestone walls, and on the floor
were the dead ashes of a small fire.</p>

<p>“Someone has been in here lately,” the guide remarked.
“Not Bart, because he wouldn’t bother
with a fire. He does most of his exploring in a bathing
suit.”</p>

<p>“A bathing suit!” gasped Miss Ward, truly astonished.
“I should think he’d freeze to death.”</p>

<p>“Not that lad,” chuckled the captain. He had
rested his lantern for a moment on a rocky ledge.
“The temperature of this cave is the same, summer
or winter. Bart wears a bathing suit because he can
crawl through narrow places better than if he had
on bulky clothes. And when he gets wet, he says he
stays warmer and dries out faster.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, there’s more to this exploration of
caves than I realized,” commented Miss Ward.
“We’ll not get wet, I trust?”</p>

<p>“No, Ma’am,” the captain promised. “There’s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
water down to the level where we’re going. Keep
your eyes out for bats though&mdash;not that the little
creatures will harm you.”</p>

<p>“Bats!” Virginia squealed. “Horrors!”</p>

<p>“They won’t hurt you,” the captain repeated.
“Not even if you touch ’em with your hand. Sometimes
they’re packed in on the walls as tight as a
swarm o’ bees. Then if they’re disturbed, the whole
mass may take flight. Bats are strange creatures.”</p>

<p>“Ardeth should be assigned to capture one for
the camp treasure chest!” Judy chuckled.</p>

<p>“We’ll go below, now,” the captain announced.
“Follow me closely, and don’t do too much talkin’.
Sound echoes in a cave and is magnified. Full steam
ahead!”</p>

<p>Step by step, the Scouts descended the narrow
passageway. The slope was an easy one, but it
seemed endless. Unable to judge distance underground,
the girls imagined they had gone a long
ways when finally the captain brought up in a gallery
approximately sixteen feet wide.</p>

<p>Walls of the room were covered with limestone
ridges and there were a few interesting stalagmites
and stalactites. Captain Hager struck one of the latter
with his stout walking stick, and it gave forth a
musical ring.</p>

<p>Waiting until the entire party had clustered
about, he slowly moved his lantern so that it threw
a circular, shadowy light on a dark portion of the
gallery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
The girls sucked in their breath, uttering exclamations
of surprise and awe.</p>

<p>There before them, was the cave witch!</p>

<p>Tall and skinny, she appeared to lean on a long,
white staff. The ice-like figure, the girls knew, had
been formed by stalagmites and stalactites which
over the years had grown together in weird formation.</p>

<p>For a long while they stood silent, held by the
ghostly spell of the old witch. In the dead stillness,
they could hear the rush of the mysterious hidden
river far below them. A cold gust of air blew across
the gallery, causing the Scouts to pull their jackets
more closely about them.</p>

<p>“How real that old witch looks!” Judy whispered,
finally breaking the silence. “No wonder folks make
up tales about this cave.”</p>

<p>Keeping his voice low to prevent echo, Captain
Hager explained that the dripstone formations were
called stalactites when they hung from the limestone
ceiling and stalagmites if they rose from the
cave floor.</p>

<p>“Each icicle-like formation, if broken, shows
growth rings not unlike those of a tree,” he related.
Some, he told the Scouts, grew very rapidly, while
others were years in the making.</p>

<p>“Usually each stalactite has a small hole in the
center through which the water flows to drip off the
end,” he went on. “When the drip-off strikes the
floor, it sometimes builds up a stalagmite as you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
them here. When the two unite, you may get any
variety of weird shapes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” protested Kathleen, “you’re taking all
the magic away from the White Witch, Captain
Hager! I prefer to imagine that she is pure white
stone.”</p>

<p>Virginia inquired if there were other interesting
formations deeper down in the cave?</p>

<p>“Aye, in the gallery below, there’s one Bart calls
the Grand Ballroom. Farther on, there’s a Frozen
Waterfall, or flowstone, as it’s called. You can see
needles and toadstools and totem poles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain Hager, take us on!” pleaded Ardeth.
“Only as far as the Ballroom. This cave is so fascinating.”</p>

<p>Before the captain could answer, Miss Ward interposed
firmly: “No, girls. Perhaps some other day,
if we have a guide, we can return.”</p>

<p>“The camp station wagon will be at Calico Cottage
before we are, if we don’t hurry,” declared
Kathleen. “This is such a wonderful grotto, I hate
to leave, but we must.”</p>

<p>Regretfully, the others agreed that further exploration
of the cave must be postponed. Leading the
way with the lantern, Captain Hager began the
steep climb. He moved slowly and in the narrow
passageway, his heavy breathing was so loud that
those behind him could hear it plainly.</p>

<p>“I’m not as spry as I was ten years ago,” the old
man confessed when the party presently reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the cave exit. “Going down is easy enough, but
when I throw ’er in reverse, my ticker starts to
pound.”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t have pressed you into taking us to
see the old witch,” Judy apologized.</p>

<p>“I was glad to do it,” the captain insisted. “Anyway,
I’m not ready yet to let old age get to the
windward of me! No, sir!”</p>

<p>The Scouts thanked their guide for taking them
on the expedition. Saying goodbye, they hastened
along the rocky path to the private road, thence to
Calico Cottage. To their relief, the camp station
wagon had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful morning!” Kathleen declared,
sitting down on the porch steps to think over the
exciting things she had seen inside the cave. “I
wish all the girls at Pine Cone Camp could see the
White Witch!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it can be arranged,” Miss Ward remarked.
“I’ll talk to Miss Lubell about it and see
what she thinks. Caves certainly are educational.”</p>

<p>“Captain Hager knows a lot about them too,”
contributed Judy. “He told us a great deal, but I
have a hunch there’s more he left unsaid.”</p>

<p>“About the White Witch?” inquired Virginia.</p>

<p>“The White Witch and maybe some other
things,” she hinted. “Both Captain Hager and Bart
seem to dislike Mr. Krumm. If it weren’t for that
personal feeling, I suspect they might tell us more
about the ghost of Calico Cottage.”</p>

<span>THE PRIVATE ROAD</span></h2>

<p class="noi">AFTER lunch at Pine Cone Camp, the Scouts busied
themselves washing their clothes and cleaning the
Beaver Patrol tent. Miss Lubell sent word by one
of the counselors that other quarters would be available
for the girls by nightfall.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have no excuse for staying at Calico
Cottage tonight,” Judy said regretfully. “You know,
that boy with the flute intrigues me!”</p>

<p>“Everyone in camp has heard about him,” added
Ardeth as she hung a blouse on the line to dry.
“We’re being teased no end. If we don’t solve the
mystery before we leave here, we’ll never hear the
last of it.”</p>

<p>Miss Ward had overheard the conversation, and
interposed a word. “It might be well for a couple of
Scouts to stay with Judy’s aunt tonight,” she proposed.
“I’m satisfied that the cottage is safe, but
strange sounds at night can be most disturbing to
a nervous person alone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with Aunt Mattie, if I may,” Judy
promptly volunteered.</p>

<p>“I’d like to myself,” added Ardeth. “While I’m
there, I want to visit the cave again. If I could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
one of those bats we heard about, we’d have a fine
entry for the nature treasure chest.”</p>

<p>“The cave is out-of-bounds without a guide,”
Miss Ward returned. “I talked to Miss Lubell about
it. She thinks we may be able to arrange a tour for
the entire camp later this week. The problem is to
find a suitable guide. It seems that with the exception
of Bart and Captain Hager, few persons go
near the place.”</p>

<p>“Someone has been in there lately,” Judy said,
reminding the teacher of the dead camp fire ashes
they had seen at the cave entrance.</p>

<p>Shortly before two o’clock, the station wagon
took Miss Ward, Judy and Ardeth to the village depot.
A smoky haze hung over the mountainside, and
the girls were somewhat disturbed to learn that a
small forest fire had broken out across the river on
Brady’s Ridge.</p>

<p>Enroute to the station they met a forest service
truck and passed a ranger with a portable radio on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The driver of the station wagon pulled up, to ask
the forest service man if the situation was considered
at all serious.</p>

<p>“Everything’s under control,” the ranger assured
him. “It’s a small brush fire. We’re keeping a close
watch of the entire area though.”</p>

<p>“How did the fire start?” inquired Miss Ward.</p>

<p>The ranger shrugged. “Perhaps from a carelessly
dropped cigarette. Or a motorist may have tossed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
match out of a car window. The fire apparently
started close to the road. You folks will be all right,
if you don’t try to cross the river. Keep on this side.”</p>

<p>The haze of smoke hung low as the station wagon
parked near the depot. Judy sniffed the fumes and
coughed.</p>

<p>“What a welcome for Aunt Mattie!” she remarked.
“She’ll be scared to death that the fire will
spread to this side of the river. And if we tell her
about the ghost&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’d do that,” Miss Ward advised.
“And least not for a day or so. Why disturb her unnecessarily?”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Judy promptly agreed. “If the
ghost makes any more trouble, Aunt Mattie will
find out about it soon enough. Mum’s the word.”</p>

<p>The train proved to be half an hour late. Finally
it rumbled in, throwing up dust and cinders. Aunt
Mattie Meadows was on the last Pullman car. She
was a jolly-faced woman of forty-two, well turned
out in a trim gray suit, with a white carnation in the
lapel.</p>

<p>“Hi, Aunt Mattie!” Judy cried, rushing to greet
her.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows enfolded her niece in a warm embrace,
and then held her off at arm’s length for a
better view.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re brown as an Indian!” she exclaimed.
“What have you done to your complexion?”</p>

<p>“Liberal doses of sun, wind and lake water,” Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
chuckled. She turned to present Miss Ward and
Ardeth.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows greeted them, made a few casual
remarks and then sniffed the air. “Goodness! Do I
smell smoke?” she demanded. “Is something on
fire?”</p>

<p>“Only a little brush across the river,” Judy said
carelessly. She picked up her aunt’s suitcase and
started for the station wagon. “Nothing to worry
about.”</p>

<p>Aunt Mattie kept sniffing the air. “Dear me, it
doesn’t seem a little fire could make so much smoke.
Judy, are you quite sure there’s no danger? You’re
not keeping anything from me?”</p>

<p>“The ranger assured us there is no danger. Don’t
give it a thought, Aunt Mattie.”</p>

<p>Miss Meadows fell silent as she was escorted to
the waiting station wagon. Nevertheless, she kept
gazing toward the horizon in the direction of the
river.</p>

<p>Going up the winding mountain road, the woman
became increasingly ill at ease. At each sharp turn,
she instinctively braced herself, as if fearing the car
would roll off into a ravine.</p>

<p>“I hope you rented a nice cottage for me, Judy,”
she chatted. “You didn’t write me a word about it.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time, Aunt Mattie. In fact, we
didn’t have any choice in selecting the cottage. We
had to take the only place available.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
“Is it a quiet place? I’ve had a hard, tiring year,
and I do want to have complete rest.”</p>

<p>“Well, Calico Cottage is off the beaten path,”
Judy replied evasively. “How quiet it will prove to
be no one can predict.”</p>

<p>The station wagon rounded a curve and slowed
to a standstill. Peering ahead, the girls saw that a
wooden barrier had been placed across part of the
highway, blocking traffic.</p>

<p>“Now what?” murmured Judy. “This wasn’t here
when we came down the mountain an hour ago.”</p>

<p>A state highway patrolman came over to the station
wagon. Recognizing the driver and the occupants,
he told them they might proceed.</p>

<p>“We’re checking every car,” he told the group.
“We have a report some hi-jackers, who took a truck
at Oelwein, are coming this way. With the forest
service tied up fighting a forest fire, and most of our
men helping ’em, they probably figured they could
slip a cargo through.”</p>

<p>“Hi-jackers!” Aunt Mattie exclaimed in dismay.
“Judy, what sort of a place is this?”</p>

<p>“Never a dull moment,” Judy responded lightly.
“You’ll love it here!”</p>

<p>“Judy, tell her about your meeting with Joe&mdash;”
Ardeth began, only to let her voice trail off as Miss
Ward directed a warning glance in her direction.</p>

<p>The station wagon moved on past the barrier and
drew up presently at Calico Cottage. Aunt Mattie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
who had fallen into a weary silence, suddenly revived
at sight of the little house.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s charming!” she cried. “Judy, you
couldn’t have found a nicer place. So peaceful looking,
set back among the trees.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope Calico Cottage lives up to its appearance,”
Judy said, leading the way across the lawn.
“Ardeth and I thought we’d stay with you tonight,
so you won’t be lonesome. Do you mind?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be happy to have you! I’m not afraid to stay
alone at night, but I’ll admit I’ll rest easier with
someone in the house. Especially with a forest fire
burning at my doorstep, and hi-jackers on the main
highway!”</p>

<p>“It’s not that bad,” Judy protested.</p>

<p>After seeing that Miss Meadows was comfortably
settled in the cottage, Miss Ward decided to return
with the station wagon driver to Pine Cone Camp.
Before leaving, she talked privately with Judy.</p>

<p>“Everything should be all right here,” she said,
“but if by chance anything does go wrong, call me
at once.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be safe and comfortable,” Judy insisted.
“No more ghost scares I hope.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lubell put a stop to that,” the teacher informed
her. “We checked and learned that it was
the Lone Tree girls who attached the bed sheet to
the bushes. They’ve promised not to pull any more
tricks.”</p>

<p>After the station wagon had departed, Judy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Ardeth helped Miss Meadows unpack. Her enthusiasm
for the cottage was boundless. She was especially
delighted with the kitchen and went about
poking in the high cupboards over the sink.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow when I am rested, I’ll straighten all
the dishes and rearrange them more to my liking,”
she announced. “I never feel that I’m settled in a
place until I’ve cleaned the cupboards.”</p>

<p>With the supplies on hand, Aunt Mattie cooked a
magnificent supper, topping it off with biscuits and
a custard pie. The meal finished, she suddenly collapsed
from weariness, leaving the dishes for Judy
and Ardeth.</p>

<p>“I declare, I don’t know what’s come over me,”
she apologized. “The long train ride must have
worn me out. I can’t keep my eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Go straight to bed, Aunt Mattie. Ardeth and I
will take care of everything.”</p>

<p>“I believe I will turn in,” Miss Meadows said,
covering a yawn. “You’ll be sure to lock all the
doors?”</p>

<p>“Every one,” Judy promised.</p>

<p>The sink was fairly loaded with dishes, for Aunt
Mattie did not skimp on them when she cooked a
meal. After scouring the last stubborn pan, Judy
hung up the dish rag with a tired sigh.</p>

<p>“Shall we turn in?” she asked Ardeth.</p>

<p>“We may as well, I guess. Wonder what the girls
are doing at Pine Cone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
“Singing songs and telling stories by the camp
fire, like as not. Wish you were there, Ardeth?”</p>

<p>“Someone should stay here this first night with
your aunt. I don’t mind, Judy. Do you suppose&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a serenade from our friend with the
flute?” Judy supplied. “For Aunt Mattie’s sake I
hope not. If she hears about a ghost on top of hi-jackers
and a forest fire, she’s likely to pack her
suitcase and leave.”</p>

<p>Ardeth had moved to the open kitchen door.
“There isn’t as much smoke in the air now,” she reported.
“Either the wind is carrying it the other direction,
or the fire has died down.”</p>

<p>After closing the windows and making certain
the doors were locked, the two girls presently went
to their bedroom which adjoined the one Miss Meadows
had taken.</p>

<p>Judy secretly had made up her mind she would
lie awake a long while to be sure that nothing went
amiss in the cottage. However, her bed was so
pleasantly comfortable, that despite her firm resolution,
she dozed off almost at once.</p>

<p>When finally she awakened, it was to find herself
being shaken by Ardeth.</p>

<p>“Get up, lazy!” the latter ordered. “It’s late! Your
aunt has been up for at least half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Jumping fishes!” Judy exclaimed in dismay, dragging
herself from beneath the covers. “I must have
slept like a log all night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
“I know I did,” Ardeth confessed. “What a fine
pair of guards we proved to be!”</p>

<p>“Well, at least nothing went wrong here,” Judy
said, pulling on her shoes. “I’m relieved on that
score.”</p>

<p>Dressing fast, the girls hastened to the kitchen.
Miss Meadows had the stove going and was cooking
cereal. She appeared pale, however, and there
were dark shadows under her eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you sleep well, Aunt Mattie?” Judy asked
politely.</p>

<p>“Very badly.”</p>

<p>Judy and Ardeth exchanged a quick, worried
glance. Both hesitated to ask the question which
was foremost in their minds.</p>

<p>“Did&mdash;did anything disturb you?” Judy managed
finally.</p>

<p>“I never sleep well the first night in a strange
place. I was awake for hours.”</p>

<p>Judy drew a long breath and grinned at Ardeth.
But her relief was brief. For Aunt Mattie went on
impressively:</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I’ll like this place as well as I
thought last night. There’s entirely too much traffic
on the side road.”</p>

<p>“You mean the main road, don’t you, Aunt Mattie?”
Judy corrected.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows stirred the pot of cereal on the
stove. “I mean that highway that runs down the hill
toward the river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
“Why, that’s a private road and it dead-ends,”
Judy responded. “There’s never any traffic in that
direction.”</p>

<p>“There was last night,” Miss Meadows insisted
firmly. “A truck came along the highway and
stopped so that the headbeams shone almost directly
into my window. The driver flashed them on
and off several times as if in signal. Then, the lights
were doused, and the truck turned down the side
road.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine a truck using that road at night,”
Judy said thoughtfully. “The road doesn’t go anywhere
except to the cave. Perhaps you were mistaken,
Aunt Mattie. Don’t you think the truck might
have gone on down the main highway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Miss Meadows replied. “No,
I’m sure the truck turned down the side road.”</p>

<p>No more was said about the matter then. But
after the breakfast dishes had been done, Ardeth
and Judy slipped outside for a private talk.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose your aunt was right about those
truck lights?” Ardeth asked, lowering her voice so
it would not carry through the open kitchen window.
“And what about that signal?”</p>

<p>“She must have been mistaken,” Judy replied
anxiously. “All the same, we certainly should investigate.
Come on, Ardeth! If that truck turned down
the dead-end road, there will be tire marks to
prove it.”</p>

<span>THE MISSING KEY</span></h2>

<p class="noi">CUTTING across the lawn which was heavy with
dew, the two girls turned toward the entrance to
the private road. A haze of smoke still hung above
the treetops, but it was evident that the fire which
had alarmed everyone the previous day, now was
well under control.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Judy halted, staring at tire marks on
the dirt road.</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie was right!” she exclaimed. “A big
truck did turn off the main highway!”</p>

<p>“The tire prints are plain to see,” Ardeth agreed,
equally startled. “But what would a heavy truck be
doing here? The road dead-ends.”</p>

<p>“It seems odd.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the driver only pulled off the pavement
to fix a tire.”</p>

<p>Judy shook her head. “The tracks plainly go down
the slope toward the cave,” she pointed out.</p>

<p>“Mightn’t it have been a forest ranger fire fighting
truck?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Judy acknowledged, “it might have
been. Maybe that would explain the headlight signals
Aunt Mattie reported seeing. I can’t imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
though, why a Forest Service truck would use this
road at night. The fire was across the river.”</p>

<p>As the girls considered whether to go farther
down the private road, they heard the rattle of a
milk wagon approaching on the main highway.</p>

<p>“It’s Bart!” Judy cried.</p>

<p>The delivery truck stopped some distance away,
but after milk had been left at Calico Cottage, came
on down the road. Bart drew up to chat with the
girls.</p>

<p>“How’s everything?” he inquired cheerfully.
“Your ghost behaving himself?”</p>

<p>Judy replied that the household had not been
disturbed further by the mysterious flute player.
She added, however, that her aunt had slept badly
and that lights from a truck had bothered her.</p>

<p>“I guess it must have been a Forest Service truck
that went down this road last night,” Ardeth remarked.
“See the tire tracks.”</p>

<p>Bart already had stepped out of the milk wagon
to inspect them.</p>

<p>“Those weren’t made by a Forest Service truck,”
he told the girls. “Their vehicles are lighter. Anyway,
I don’t know what a forest truck would be doing
here late at night. Seems sort of queer&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I thought so myself!” Judy said quickly.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look-see,” Bart proposed. “Want to
ride down the hill with me? If you do, hop in!”</p>

<p>Judy and Ardeth scrambled into the cab, taking
care not to step on Pete who was asleep on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
“Do you dare leave your milk route?” Ardeth
asked the young driver.</p>

<p>“I’m ahead of schedule this morning,” Bart answered.
“I can take a few minutes. This is my last
week on the route anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’re taking another job?” Ardeth inquired politely.</p>

<p>By this time the milk truck had turned and was
moving slowly down the narrow, rutty road.</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” Bart admitted. “I’ve saved enough
money to see me through a year of college. I’m laying
off because I want to do a little exploring before
I start in at school this fall.”</p>

<p>“Exploring?” Judy repeated with interest. “Of the
cavern?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.” Bart grinned, as he slowed down
for a bad hole in the road. “Folks hereabouts think
I’m crazy to spend so much time in a cave. It’s in
my blood, I guess! I’m planning on becoming a scientist
if I make the grade.”</p>

<p>“Does Calico Cave have any bats or other interesting
birds or animals?” Ardeth questioned abruptly.</p>

<p>“Hundreds of bats. You can see them clustered in
masses on the walls in one section of the cave, near
the entrance.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” Judy shuddered.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re harmless,” Bart assured her. “I
suppose you think of a bat as a naked, winged creature
with claws that would catch in your hair?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
“I never came very close to one,” Judy admitted,
“but I do feel that way about them.”</p>

<p>“Like a great many folks, you do the bat an injustice,”
Bart returned. “Its little claws are used
only to provide a means of clinging to a rock wall.
Bats are afraid of people. They fly at amazing speed,
but they can dodge any obstacle.”</p>

<p>“They sleep in the caves?” Ardeth questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, the bat, you know, is descended from an
animal that lived in a warm, uniform climate. For
some reason, the bat never has been able to adapt
itself to weather changes, so it hibernates in caves
which have an almost constant temperature.”</p>

<p>“I’d give anything if I had a bat!” Ardeth announced.
“Just one!”</p>

<p>“A bat? What would you want with it?” Bart
asked, rather amused by the remark.</p>

<p>Ardeth told him about the nature treasure chest
at Pine Cone Camp. “Our unit hasn’t contributed
anything, as yet,” she added. “If I could get one of
those bats, we’d really be the talk of the camp.”</p>

<p>“I think I can get you one,” Bart offered, glancing
at his wristwatch. “You’re serious about wanting
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but I don’t want to delay you on your
run.”</p>

<p>“If the bats are where I think they’ll be, I can
pick one off the wall in a minute or two,” Bart
promised. “Want to go into the cave with me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
“I don’t think we should without permission from
our leader,” Judy said quickly.</p>

<p>“I can travel faster alone at any rate,” the young
milkman replied.</p>

<p>As the milk truck rattled on down the winding
road, he talked enthusiastically about bats and their
habits.</p>

<p>The creatures, he told the girls, had silky, translucent
wings and flew with astonishing precision.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen ’em fly between water and ceiling
down deep in the cave where there was barely
clearance,” he related. “Now, if only I were a bat,
I’d explore that siphon!”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t even think of such a thing!” Judy
chided. “It would be frightfully dangerous.”</p>

<p>Bart made no answer.</p>

<p>“You’re not considering it, are you?” Judy demanded,
alarmed by his silence.</p>

<p>“I’ve considered it for years,” Bart answered soberly.
“I think about it all the time, in fact. I’ve
just about decided&mdash;” he deliberately broke off, and
finished: “Now to tell you more about bats&mdash;they
hang to the ceilings by their feet, head down. Their
bodies are covered by their long, folded wings
when they sleep. One can pick them off the wall,
and they make no fuss.”</p>

<p>“Ardeth, must you have a bat?” Judy tried to discourage
her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, if I can get one without causing too
much trouble. But how will I get it to camp?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Bart had pulled up at the end of the private road.
From the back end of the truck, he brought out a
cardboard box with a cover.</p>

<p>“We can use this,” he suggested. “I may not get
a bat for you though. I haven’t long to ramble
through the cave this trip.”</p>

<p>Tucking the cardboard box under his arm, the
cheerful young milkman stepped from the truck.
Alertly he gazed at a sizeable slick of oil on the
roadside, remarking that it evidently had leaked
from the parked truck.</p>

<p>“Apparently, it stayed here quite a while last
night before turning around and pulling out,” he
added.</p>

<p>“What would a truck be doing down here late
at night?” Judy speculated.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know,” Bart answered with a shrug.
“Interesting question though.”</p>

<p>He started off down the path which led to Calico
Cave. Before vanishing from view amid the bushes,
he paused to fling over his shoulder: “Don’t try to
follow me, even if I’m not back in a few minutes.
Wait in the milk wagon.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes elapsed, then fifteen and twenty.
Eagerly the girls began to watch the path for their
friend to reappear.</p>

<p>The rising sun beat down harder and harder on
the milk wagon, causing Judy and Ardeth increasing
discomfort. They became restless.</p>

<p>“It’s taking Bart an awfully long time,” Ardeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
remarked uneasily. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have asked
him to get a bat for me. If anything should happen&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’ll be along soon,” Judy said. “I think I hear
him coming now.”</p>

<p>She was right, for a moment later, the young
milkman emerged from the tunnel of branches at
the trail’s exit.</p>

<p>“Did you get one?” Ardeth cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure did,” Bart responded.</p>

<p>Coming over to the milk truck, he opened the
punctured lid of the cardboard box, so that the girls
could peep at the frightened creature flopping inside.</p>

<p>“After you’ve displayed him at camp, better let
him fly away,” the milkman advised. “He’ll find his
way back to the cave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t want to keep him shut up,” Ardeth
replied. “That would be cruel. I promise to let
him go by tonight.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” Bart approved, climbing into the milk
wagon and starting the motor. “Now I want you
girls to make me another one.”</p>

<p>“Another promise?” asked Ardeth, carefully holding
the box Bart had placed in her hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, I want you to stay away from here unless
you’re with a forest ranger or some man.”</p>

<p>“Away from the cave, you mean?” Judy questioned,
rather surprised by the request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
“From the cave, and also away from this private
road.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” Bart said soberly. By this time he
had turned the milk truck around in the narrow
road and had headed it up the hill. “There’s something
going on here that will bear investigation.”</p>

<p>“The truck tire tracks, you mean?” interposed
Ardeth, mystified by the remark.</p>

<p>“At first, that didn’t seem very disturbing,” Bart
said. “But I’ve since made a discovery. That was
why it took me so long.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t run into anyone in the cave?” Judy
asked quickly.</p>

<p>“No, but someone has been there recently. Last
night probably.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Someone had trampled the path to the cave. Boot
tracks. Then inside the entrance chamber, I found
cigarette butts and long marks, showing where
heavy objects had been dragged across the floor.
Boxes, I’d judge.”</p>

<p>“All removed?” Judy questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, no sign of anyone or anything in the cave
now.”</p>

<p>“You think someone must have come here last
night in that truck and used the cave?”</p>

<p>“Obviously, Judy. But don’t quiz me, because
I’ve told you everything I learned. I’m not venturing
any guesses as to who it was or why the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
or persons came here late at night. My advice is
just to keep clear of the place until we can learn
what’s going on.”</p>

<p>“Judy and I are returning to camp this morning,”
Ardeth informed the young milkman. “So even if
we wanted to prowl around, we wouldn’t have an
opportunity.”</p>

<p>“That’s all to the good then,” Bart grinned. “There
may be no cause for alarm, but it’s just as well not
to take chances.”</p>

<p>At the turn-off onto the paved road, he said goodbye
to the Scouts and resumed his milk route.</p>

<p>Triumphantly, Ardeth and Judy bore their captured
bat to Calico Cottage where they displayed it
to Miss Meadows. Though they related how they
had obtained the creature, they did not repeat Bart’s
warning or mention what they had learned about
the big truck.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows seemed to have forgotten the disturbance
of the previous night completely. After
making a show of admiring the imprisoned bat, she
chirped:</p>

<p>“While you girls were away, I cleaned the cupboards.”</p>

<p>“They’re very neat and tidy now,” Judy said,
opening the double doors to inspect the rows of
china.</p>

<p>“At the back of the cupboard, I found a key,”
Miss Meadows remarked casually. She produced it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
from her apron pocket. “Apparently, it fits a door.
But which one I wouldn’t know.”</p>

<p>Judy rocked back on her heels and looked quickly
at Ardeth. Neither spoke for a moment.</p>

<p>Finally, Judy trusted her voice. Taking care to
keep it steady, to give no hint of her excitement and
hope, she said quietly:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if that key fits the cellar
door, Aunt Mattie.”</p>

<p>“Why, it might at that.”</p>

<p>Judy forced herself to speak casually, as if the
matter were of no great moment.</p>

<p>“The key looks about the right size,” she remarked.
“Do you mind if I try it?”</p>

<span>A FAMILIAR FACE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">MISS Meadows willingly relinquished the key
which she had found in the kitchen cupboard.</p>

<p>Judy fitted it in the door lock and was elated
when it turned readily. Her pose of indifference
instantly dissolved.</p>

<p>“Now we can get into the cellar!” she exulted.
“Whoopee!”</p>

<p>Miss Meadows could not understand her niece’s
exuberance. The key was only an ordinary one so
far as she knew, and until that moment she scarcely
had noted that the basement was closed off.</p>

<p>The opening of the cellar door had brought a
whiff of stale, cool air into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Poised at the head of the long flight of stone
stairs, Judy peered down into the darkness. In vain
she groped for a light switch.</p>

<p>“I guess the cellar never was equipped with electricity,”
she remarked. “I’ll get my flashlight.”</p>

<p>She ran to the bedroom, returning a moment
later to find Miss Meadows regarding the stairway
with disapproval.</p>

<p>“Need we go down there, Judy?” she asked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
discourage her. “Since the door was locked, the
cottage owner might prefer us to keep it so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can relock the door,” Judy answered,
flashing her light over the rough brick wall along
the steep stairway. “First though, I want to see
what’s below.”</p>

<p>Focusing her light upon the uneven stone steps,
she cautiously started down.</p>

<p>“Watch your footing,” she advised Ardeth and
her aunt, who followed close behind. “These steps
are narrow and worn.”</p>

<p>Miss Meadows remarked that the cellar seemed
very old in contrast to the new cottage.</p>

<p>“It is old,” Judy agreed. “When Mr. Krumm built
the cottage, he tried to save money by using the
foundation of Captain Hager’s place.”</p>

<p>Judy negotiated the stairway safely and waited
for the others at a jagged doorway which opened
into the main cellar chamber.</p>

<p>The basement was very still, except for the shuffle
of the descending feet.</p>

<p>“No musical chimes or the like?” Ardeth demanded
with a suppressed giggle as she reached
the bottom of the stairway.</p>

<p>Moving through the stone archway, the three
found themselves in a large room. The chamber was
dry, but nevertheless gave forth a musty odor.</p>

<p>The ancient brick walls were lined with shelves,
all of which appeared empty. In fact, the only visible
objects in the room were a half dozen old barrels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
The casks lay helter-skelter, some on their
sides, and others up-ended.</p>

<p>Judy deliberately walked around the barrels, inspecting
them closely and kicking at them with her
foot. All gave forth a hollow sound, which echoed
in the chamber room.</p>

<p>Satisfied that every cask was empty, Judy next
turned her attention to a smaller storage closet off
to the left.</p>

<p>“This must have been the fruit and vegetable
storage room,” she declared. “It’s been cleaned out
though.”</p>

<p>The shelves were completely bare, and the roving
flashlight revealed only an undisturbed layer
of dust.</p>

<p>“We’ve seen everything,” Ardeth said, losing interest.
“I think we should be getting upstairs. The
camp station wagon will be coming for us any minute
now.”</p>

<p>It was well that they had cut short their inspection
of the basement, for within five minutes the
camp station wagon drove up.</p>

<p>In a flurry to be off, Judy and Ardeth hurriedly
gathered their few belongings and the precious bat
from Calico Cave.</p>

<p>“Now have a good time in camp and don’t keep
trying to look after me,” Miss Meadows admonished
as she bade the girls goodbye. “Drop by
whenever you feel like it, but don’t think you have
to stay here over night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
“I don’t like you to remain alone,” Judy began
only to have her aunt interrupt.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I’ll be all right. Now run along, and
enjoy your friends.”</p>

<p>In truth, Judy was somewhat relieved to know
that there was no reason for the Scouts to remain
each night at Calico Cottage. Although the mysterious
flute sounds had not been explained, and might
never be, she and Ardeth had convinced themselves
that no danger lurked in the cellar.</p>

<p>As for Bart’s warning not to go near the cave
without a male escort, Judy decided that to pass on
the admonition to her aunt, might only cause uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie never will set foot inside that cave,”
she reflected. “So why worry her needlessly? She’ll
probably never see those truck lights again.”</p>

<p>At Pine Cone Camp a few minutes later, Judy
and Ardeth created a sensation by producing their
captive bat. The other Scouts generously credited
the Beaver Patrol girls with having the very best
treasure chest entry. Everyone was satisfied when
Miss Lubell announced that they had won the competition.</p>

<p>“We certainly got in just under the wire,” Ardeth
chuckled, when informed that her bat had taken
first honors. “Now I’ll let him fly away, and hope
he returns to Calico Cave safely.”</p>

<p>Making up for time which of necessity had been
spent away from camp, Judy had a wonderful day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
with her friends. She swam, went sailboating, and
in the late afternoon helped set the table for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>Later that night, all the girls enjoyed a sing-fest
and took part in folk dancing.</p>

<p>“What a grand day!” Judy declared blissfully as
she sought her tent a few minutes before the “lights
out” signal. “I hope Aunt Mattie doesn’t run into
trouble. I feel guilty, knowing she’s alone at the
cottage.”</p>

<p>She dropped off to sleep quickly, determined to
check on affairs at Calico Cottage the first thing in
the morning.</p>

<p>Judy’s intentions were the very best. Nevertheless,
she awoke late and was hard pressed to dress
and be on time for breakfast. Thereafter, she found
herself assigned to kitchen detail with Beverly and
Kathleen.</p>

<p>The three spent until lunch time peeling apples
for pie and washing vegetables. Even after luncheon,
Judy did not get to a telephone, for the unit
leader hurried her off to her tent to prepare for a
hike.</p>

<p>In connection with the hike, the Scouts planned
to visit one of the nearby ranger towers. A brisk
walk through the forest brought them presently
to a cleared area from which arose a tall, steel
framework.</p>

<p>The Scouts climbed the steep stairway to a
glassed-in square observation room. A ranger, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
had been poring over a map on a table, greeted
the visitors in a friendly way and invited them to
look about.</p>

<p>After answering a number of questions, he showed
the girls an automatic fire-finder, an instrument
which permitted an observer to read with precision
both vertical and horizontal angles. By means
of the device, a newly discovered fire could be pinpointed,
and rangers immediately dispatched to the
area.</p>

<p>“We have a network of ten observation towers
in this particular area,” he informed the Scouts.
“Even so all points cannot be viewed, so we find it
necessary to maintain ground patrols as well.”</p>

<p>“Can one see Pine Cone Camp from here?” Judy
inquired.</p>

<p>“No, the camp is one of our blind spots, unfortunately,”
the ranger replied. “Rest assured, it is
well protected though. Lowell Diethelm patrols
that area. His Forest Service car is equipped with
radio telephone. If he should observe a fire, he
immediately would notify headquarters. Ground
fighters would be dispatched at once.”</p>

<p>“Do you have many fires here during the summer?”
Kathleen inquired.</p>

<p>“Until this year, very few. Recently, we’ve had
a number of small ones, mostly along the main
highway. A few though, have been of mysterious
origin.”</p>

<p>“Deliberately set?” questioned Judy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
“We’re beginning to wonder,” the ranger answered.
“Carelessness, of course, is the underlying
cause of most fires. But incendiarism runs high too.
Now that so many summer campers and tourists are
pouring into the area, we have to be especially
watchful.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the observation tower, the Scouts
studied the big topographical map and took turns
peering through the binoculars.</p>

<p>“Well, come again girls,” the ranger invited as
they prepared to leave. “Be careful of your fires.
And remember, if you do see one, report it at once.
Discovery time counts for a lot.”</p>

<p>Leaving the observation tower, the Scouts hiked
on for another mile and a half. By the time they
reached the Fountain Falls trail, everyone was beginning
to feel the first pangs of hunger.</p>

<p>“When do we eat?” Virginia demanded.</p>

<p>“Soon,” promised the unit leader. “I’ll get the
fire started while you girls see the falls. I obtained
a permit, so we’re violating no rules to build our
own.”</p>

<p>The girls helped gather wood. Then, while the
fire was burning down to bright cherry coals, those
not delegated to watch, climbed a steep path to
Fountain Falls.</p>

<p>A veil-like spray of water fell nearly thirty feet
to a rocky shelf below. Ferns and moss protruded
from cracks in the limestone rock.</p>

<p>After admiring the sight for some minutes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Scouts retraced their way to help with supper. Already
a huge tin can was warming on the coals,
filled with a fragrant chowder mixture of bacon,
onions, canned corn and potatoes.</p>

<p>By the time Judy had toasted bread, the other
simple items of the meal were ready. The crisp
mountain air had given everyone enormous appetites.
However, there was sufficient food for everyone.</p>

<p>Once the litter had been cleared away and the
last marshmallow toasted, the unit leader personally
supervised putting out the camp fire.</p>

<p>She had the girls smother it with water brought
from the nearby creek. Then to make certain that
not a spark remained, she covered the dead coals
with a heavy layer of soil.</p>

<p>“Now it’s time to hike down to Silverton,” she
advised the group as she consulted her watch. “The
time has gone very fast.”</p>

<p>The downhill hike was comparatively easy and
the group made faster time than had been expected.
As a consequence, they arrived in the village at
twenty minutes to seven.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a short wait until the station wagon
comes,” the unit leader told the girls. “It shouldn’t
be long though.”</p>

<p>The group had been instructed to meet their
driver at Luke’s Cafe, one of the few business establishments
open after six o’clock.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they went in, taking tables and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
booths. Some of the girls ordered ice cream. Judy
finished hers quickly, and then left the booth to
pay her bill at the counter.</p>

<p>Two men were seated on stools, drinking coffee
and munching hamburger sandwiches.</p>

<p>Judy cast an indifferent glance in their direction,
and than looked again, more intently. One of the
men she had never seen before, but she was certain
she recognized the other.</p>

<p>“That’s Joe Pompilli!” she thought excitedly. “The
man who was hurt in the truck accident! The same
hi-jacker that the State Highway Patrol wants to
nail!”</p>

<p>As she considered what she should do, Kathleen
sauntered out of another booth. Judy signaled to
her.</p>

<p>Once Kathleen had joined her, she informed her
of her suspicion.</p>

<p>Kathleen studied the man that Judy pointed out.
“Yes, he’s the one we helped!” she whispered. “The
one who was called Joe!”</p>

<p>“He’s wanted by the Highway Patrol,” Judy replied
grimly, her mind made up. “Kathleen, stay
here and keep your eye on those two men. Don’t
let them recognize you, if you can prevent it. I’m
going to slip out of here and telephone!”</p>

<span>JUDY’S MISTAKE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">RUSHING out of the cafe, Judy scarcely knew
which way to go. Across the street, lights were on
at the corner drugstore, so she decided to seek a
telephone there.</p>

<p>As she darted to the opposite curb, she spied one
of the forest rangers, who only that moment had
emerged from a barber shop.</p>

<p>Judy had seen the Forest Service man several
times since her arrival at Pine Cone Camp and
knew that his name was Lowell Diethelm.</p>

<p>Now, instantly recognizing his face and uniform,
a wave of relief swept over her. He would know
how to help her notify the State Highway Patrol
quickly!</p>

<p>“Oh, ranger!” she called, for in the excitement of
the moment, his name temporarily fled from her
mind.</p>

<p>“Yes?” The ranger turned to regard Judy with
intent curiosity.</p>

<p>“Can you help me make a report to the State
Highway Department right away?”</p>

<p>“Why sure,” the ranger replied. “What’s wrong?
An automobile accident?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Judy jerked her head to indicate the cafe across
the street. “Two men are in there eating lunch,”
she explained, trying to hold her voice steady. “I’m
sure one of them is Joe Pompilli!”</p>

<p>“Not the hi-jacker?”</p>

<p>Judy’s head bobbed excitedly. “I know he’s the
same one Kathleen and I helped the other day
when a truck went off the road. I want to get word
to the State Highway Department right away.”</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” the ranger advised as Judy turned
as if to start off alone. “You’re mistaken, I think.
Joe Pompilli wouldn’t dare to show himself openly
here.”</p>

<p>“It does seem a reckless thing for him to do,”
Judy conceded. “But I’m sure the man is the same
one.”</p>

<p>“You must be wrong, but to prove it I’ll go over
with you to the cafe,” Diethelm offered.</p>

<p>Crossing the street, Judy and the ranger peered
in through the big plate glass window. The two
truckers still were seated at the lunch counter.</p>

<p>“Which one do you say is Joe?” the ranger demanded.</p>

<p>“The one with the square jaw, seated next to the
wall. I never saw the other man before.”</p>

<p>Diethelm began to chuckle in a hard sort of manner
which grated unpleasantly on Judy’s ears.</p>

<p>“Why are you laughing?” she asked. “Isn’t that
man Joe Pompilli?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life. Both those men are truckers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
for the Peoria Cartage Co., and they make this town
every few days. It’s lucky you ran into me before
you went blabbering your suspicions to the State
Highway patrol. If you’d accused those two of being
hi-jackers, they might not have liked it.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t understand it, unless I was misinformed
by the state highwaymen,” Judy stammered,
completely crushed by the mistake she had made.
“That man certainly was hurt in an accident. He’s
wearing a wrist bandage and there are cuts on his
face! The other Scouts and myself gave him first
aid treatment.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Ranger Diethelm replied
with a shrug. “The state patrolmen either
made a mistake in identifying him, or gave you the
wrong dope.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t I call Highway headquarters to make
sure?”</p>

<p>“You’ll be making a silly mistake if you do,”
warned the ranger. “A mistake that will make your
Scout organization the laughing stock of the community.
Take my word for it, those two men are
Jim Brady and Donald Fine, two highly respected
truckers. But go ahead if you want to make the
call.”</p>

<p>Lowell Diethelm’s words, and particularly his
air of amusement, robbed Judy of all desire to risk
action which might hold up her organization to
possible ridicule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
She hesitated. The ranger mistook her silence for
unwillingness to follow his suggestion.</p>

<p>“Instead of trying to track down criminals, you
Scouts would do better to look after affairs around
your own camp,” he said cuttingly.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Judy, startled.
She had detected a hostile note in the ranger’s
voice.</p>

<p>“You girls should be more careful about starting
camp fires.”</p>

<p>“We’re always careful,” Judy insisted indignantly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have a fire this afternoon at Fountain
Falls?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we were granted a permit. We took
great care with our fire, dousing the coals with
water and covering the dead ashes with dirt as an
added precaution.”</p>

<p>“Well, not thirty minutes ago, our spotter at
Tower 32 reported a small fire close to the Falls.
Fortunately, it was put out before it spread.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been our fire, and we shouldn’t
be blamed for it,” Judy said, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Some member of your party may have dropped
a lighted match.”</p>

<p>“None of us had any. Only our leader carried
matches.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know how the fire started,” the
ranger admitted. “Just be more careful, that’s all.
Now about reporting this trucker you think is Joe
Pompilli&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
“I guess I must have made a mistake,” Judy
mumbled. “Sorry to have bothered you.”</p>

<p>“No trouble at all,” Diethelm replied, as he
smiled as if suddenly relieved. “We rangers always
try to be of service. Watch those fires now!”</p>

<p>Tipping his broad-brimmed hat, he sauntered on
down the darkening street.</p>

<p>With mingled feelings, Judy was watching the
retreating figure. Humiliated that she had made a
mistake in identifying Joe Pompilli, she nevertheless
was annoyed at the ranger for trying to accuse
the Scouts in connection with a newly discovered
fire.</p>

<p>“I think he dragged that in just to bother me,”
she thought resentfully. “But why should he take
such an attitude?”</p>

<p>As Judy stood by the cafe window, wondering
what to do, Kathleen signaled to her from the inside.
Her friend’s meaning was not immediately
clear. Then she comprehended that the two truckers
were paying their bill, preparatory to leaving the
cafe.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to let them go,” Judy decided. “Nothing
else to do.”</p>

<p>A moment later the two truckers came outside.
Judy did not try to stop them, but they passed almost
in front of her.</p>

<p>The one she had taken to be Joe Pompilli gazed
squarely at her. Involuntarily, he half stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Then, deliberately turning his gaze away, he went
on.</p>

<p>“He recognized me!” Judy thought, her pulse
pounding. “I know he was that same man Kathleen
and I helped on the road. He was called Joe too!”</p>

<p>Ignoring the girl entirely, the two men went on.
Judy saw them get into a truck which bore the
Peoria Cartage Co., name on its side. A moment
before they drove away, she jotted down the license
number.</p>

<p>She had just finished scribbling the numbers on
the back of an old envelope, when Kathleen joined
her.</p>

<p>“What happened?” her friend demanded. “I
thought you were going to have those men arrested.
Couldn’t you reach the Highway Patrol station?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t try,” Judy confessed ruefully.</p>

<p>“You didn’t try? Why not?”</p>

<p>Judy recounted her conversation with the ranger.</p>

<p>“He talked me out of it,” she concluded. “I can’t
help thinking I made a mistake too. I wish I’d
ignored his advice. It’s too late now, of course.”</p>

<p>“I know that man was the same one we met,”
Kathleen insisted.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it too,” Judy nodded. “Ranger Diethelm
insists he’s an ordinary trucker and his name
is either Jim Brady or Donald Fine.”</p>

<p>“Well, that doesn’t fit in with what we learned,”
Kathleen declared, shaking her head. “That man
was called Joe by his friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“I know,” Judy agreed with a deep sigh. “I’m all
mixed up. I guess the best thing to do is to forget
those hi-jackers and let the state patrol handle the
situation. I’ve made a mess of it!”</p>

<p>“No such thing,” Kathleen insisted loyally. “We
may have made a mistake, but if so, it wasn’t our
fault. We must have acted on mis-information.”</p>

<p>Judy grinned and squeezed her friend’s hand.
“You’re a dear,” she said, “always bucking up my
morale. Do me a favor?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then, let’s keep this little episode to ourselves.
The other Scouts didn’t hear about it?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t say a word to anyone. I just kept
out of view and watched those two men as you suggested.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Judy drew a relieved sigh. “If this gets
out on me, my name will be mud! You know, I’m
already being teased at Pine Cone Camp because
of the Calico Cottage ghost!”</p>

<p>“We’re all taking a ribbing because of that boy
with the flute,” Kathleen admitted. “Any theory as
to what causes the strange sounds?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” Judy replied. “Everything was
quiet the last night I spent at the cottage. I’m wondering
though, how Aunt Mattie got along last evening?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps our driver will stop at the cottage for a
few minutes, so we can check.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
“I intend to ask him,” Judy returned. “It must
be seven o’clock now.”</p>

<p>“It is,” Kathleen agreed, “and our driver is coming
now!”</p>

<p>She had sighted the familiar camp station wagon
rounding a corner. It waited for a traffic light and
then came on, to park in front of the restaurant.</p>

<p>The driver had been instructed to make two trips,
as not all of the girls could be seated in the vehicle.
Accordingly, he designated those who should remain
behind.</p>

<p>Judy, Kathleen and other members of the Beaver
Patrol, managed to find a place for themselves in
the first load.</p>

<p>On short time, the driver told Judy he could not
possibly wait at Calico Cottage. However, he compromised
by agreeing to let her and Kathleen off
there, while he continued on to camp. Then on the
second trip, he would pick them up.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy!” Judy approved. “That will
give us nearly an hour to talk to Aunt Mattie and
make certain everything is all right.”</p>

<p>The station wagon climbed the darkening mountain
road, presently halting near the cottage. As
Kathleen and Judy alighted, they noticed that lights
blazed everywhere inside the dwelling.</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie is here all right!” Judy remarked,
leading the way across the lawn. “I wonder why
she has all the lights burning?”</p>

<p>“So early too,” Kathleen added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Even before the Scouts reached the front door,
it was flung open by Miss Meadows, who had noted
the arrival of the station wagon.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you came!” the woman exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her face seemed drained of all color, and her
eyes had a frightened look.</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Mattie!” Judy exclaimed. “Is anything
wrong?”</p>

<p>“This dreadful cottage!”</p>

<p>“You’ve been hearing music?” Judy surmised.</p>

<p>“Music?”</p>

<p>“What was it that upset you?” Judy asked, realizing
she had made a poor guess. “Not another
one of those mysterious telephone calls?”</p>

<p>“No! No!” Miss Meadows stepped back so that
the girls might enter the cottage. “Just come in,”
she invited. “Then you’ll hear for yourselves, and
I won’t need to explain!”</p>

<span>ANOTHER DISTURBANCE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">SCARCELY knowing what to expect, Judy and
Kathleen entered Calico Cottage. Everything appeared
quite normal, except that a chair in the
kitchen had been overturned.</p>

<p>“I upset it myself,” Miss Meadows explained. “I&mdash;I
was rather excited, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Tell us what happened, Aunt Mattie,” Judy
urged. “What disturbed you?”</p>

<p>“It was a dreadful sound from the basement. A
sort of moan as if someone were in pain. And then
to top it, there came a series of loud thumps, very
much like muffled thunder.”</p>

<p>“That couldn’t have been someone setting off
dynamite at a distance?” Kathleen suggested. “I
know the rangers were blasting trees in the park
area.”</p>

<p>“This sound came from the cellar,” Miss Meadows
insisted.</p>

<p>“How long ago, Aunt Mattie?” questioned Judy.</p>

<p>“About ten minutes, I’d judge.”</p>

<p>“Did you go down there to check?”</p>

<p>“To the cellar?” Miss Meadows demanded. “I
most assuredly did not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
“Then I guess the job is up to us,” Judy said,
looking directly at Kathleen. “Where’s that key?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you should go down into that
dreary hole,” Miss Meadows protested.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Aunt Mattie! We investigated once
before, and everything was all right. You’ve not had
the door unlocked since?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, not. I’ve been here at the cottage
all the while too.”</p>

<p>“Then no one could be down there.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t imagine those weird sounds,” Miss
Meadows said. “If you had been here&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly she stiffened. From beneath the kitchen
floor there issued forth a series of muffled
thuds.</p>

<p>“Hear it?” Miss Meadows whispered, staring fixedly
at the locked cellar door.</p>

<p>The sound ceased and the cottage was as quiet as
before. Judy and Kathleen stood transfixed, dreading
to take the action which they felt they must.</p>

<p>“Where’s that key?” Judy finally murmured, groping
for it on the high kitchen shelf.</p>

<p>“Don’t go down there,” Miss Meadows advised
nervously. “It might be dangerous.”</p>

<p>“It’s worse not to investigate,” Judy insisted. “You
can’t stay here and live in constant dread.”</p>

<p>Her fingers closed upon the key. She unlocked
the door, but hesitated as she peered down the
dark stairway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
“Do you have a flashlight?” she asked Kathleen,
who huddled at her elbow.</p>

<p>“In my knapsack,” Kathleen replied. “But I left
it on the station wagon, never thinking I’d want it
here.”</p>

<p>“There are candles on the shelf,” Miss Meadows
remembered. “I’ll get one, if you insist on going
down there. I’d rather just move out of this place
though!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where you’ll find another cottage
on short notice,” Judy told her regretfully. “Everything
around here has been taken.”</p>

<p>“I can go to a hotel.”</p>

<p>“The closest one is eighteen miles away. Aunt
Mattie, I don’t like to urge you to stay, but there
must be a logical explanation for these strange
noises. I mean to find it too! Let me have one of
those candles.”</p>

<p>Miss Meadows found it for her, and lighted the
wick.</p>

<p>“Watch the drip of the wax,” she advised, “or
you’ll burn your hand.”</p>

<p>The glowing candle made a flickering, ghostly
circle of light on the rough walls of the stairway.</p>

<p>Resolutely, Judy started down. Close behind her
came Kathleen, while Miss Meadows unwillingly
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Judy descended a half dozen steps, only to pause.
A slight breath of air caused the candle to waver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and nearly go out. And at the same moment, she
caught an unpleasant odor which seemed to rise
from the darkness below.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” gasped Miss Meadows, as she too
sniffed the air.</p>

<p>The musty scent became stronger as the three
went on down. Judy localized it in the main cellar
room, toward the south east wall.</p>

<p>However, in slowly moving the candle about, she
could find no cause for the unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>“It’s such a strange smell,” Kathleen commented
with a nervous shiver. “A sort of stale air scent. But
from where does it come?”</p>

<p>Judy asked Kathleen to hold the candle. Carefully,
she ran her hand over the brick wall, feeling
along the line of crumbling mortar.</p>

<p>“There’s an opening here!” she suddenly exclaimed.
“I can feel cool air coming in!”</p>

<p>Excited by Judy’s discovery, Kathleen held the
candle higher.</p>

<p>As she raised it in line with the brick which
Judy’s exploring hand had found, a direct current
of air extinguished the flame.</p>

<p>The three were left in total darkness.</p>

<p>“I’ll get some matches,” Miss Meadows said
eager to be out of the basement. “But is there any
need to explore further? Haven’t we discovered
everything there is to learn?”</p>

<p>“Not quite everything,” said Judy. “We’ve learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
where that musty odor comes from though. It is
being blasted in through the broken mortar.”</p>

<p>“How strange,” Kathleen murmured. “Shouldn’t
there be solid dirt or rock behind these walls and
under the floor?”</p>

<p>“One would think so,” Judy agreed thoughtfully,
“unless&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There might be a tunnel connected with the
cottage!” Kathleen speculated.</p>

<p>“A tunnel, possibly tied up with Calico Cave,”
Judy carried on the thought. “Even so, that doesn’t
explain those strange banging noises.”</p>

<p>Leaving the girls alone in the cellar, Miss
Meadows went quickly for matches. She returned
promptly and the candle was relighted.</p>

<p>This time, Judy was careful to shield it with her
hand so that it would not be blown out.</p>

<p>In the uncertain light, the three were able to see
a faint, rectangular outline on the wall, which
marked a division between old and newer bricks.</p>

<p>“At one time, there must have been an opening
here!” Judy asserted, elated by her discovery. “A
long while ago, apparently, the passageway or whatever
it is, was bricked over. Now that the mortar
is falling away, cold air filters in.”</p>

<p>“From where?” Kathleen demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll have to learn, if we can. I have
a hunch Captain Hager might be able to supply
interesting information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
“I’ll bet he could at that!” cried Kathleen. “Since
he lived in the old house so many years, he must
have known about this bricked up place on the
wall. In fact, he may have closed it himself.”</p>

<p>“The captain hinted that Mr. Krumm made a
bad mistake in building the cottage on the old foundation,”
Judy recalled. “I’m sure he knows a lot
about this place that he hasn’t told!”</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t it be great if we could solve the
mystery before we leave Pine Cone Camp? You’d
win a rental bonus too from Mr. Krumm, Judy!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about that part, but it would be fun
to hit upon an explanation for everything that’s
happened here. The thing that puzzles me most is
that boy with the flute&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Boy with a flute?” Miss Meadow interposed, her
voice rising.</p>

<p>Judy regretted her slip of tongue. Nevertheless,
having made the mistake, she could do no less than
tell her aunt about the strange musical notes which
had startled the Scouts during the night they had
spent at the cottage.</p>

<p>“What manner of place have I rented?” Miss
Meadows gasped. “Is the cottage haunted?”</p>

<p>“By the spirit of the White Witch,” Judy said
with a giggle. Then, becoming sober, she added:
“I’m sure there’s no danger here, Aunt Mattie. Even
so, you mustn’t stay another night. Come with us to
Pine Cone Camp. We’ll find a bed for you, and
tomorrow we can start looking for another cottage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
“And have everyone say I was frightened away?”
Miss Meadows reproved her niece. “The very idea!”</p>

<p>“You mean you’re willing to stay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I intend to,” Miss Meadows announced
firmly. “At least for a day or so.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remain with you,” Judy offered. “Not that
I’ll be any protection.”</p>

<p>To her surprise, Miss Meadows turned her aside.
“No,” she told Judy, “you’ve already lost a great
deal of camp fun on my account. You’re not to
worry about me any more, or Calico Cottage.”</p>

<p>“But to leave you alone&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll manage,” Miss Meadows said dryly. “Let’s
go upstairs now, or you girls will miss your station
wagon.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, I forgot about the driver calling for
us!” Kathleen exclaimed. “We’ve been down here
in the cellar quite a while.”</p>

<p>Hastily, the three ascended to the main floor of
the cottage. Miss Meadows locked the cellar door
and replaced the key on the cupboard shelf.</p>

<p>“I intend to forget about those stupid noises,”
she asserted. “It will take a very powerful ghost indeed
to dislodge me from my bed tonight.”</p>

<p>Greatly relieved that her aunt was taking such a
matter-of-fact view of an unpleasant situation, Judy
said no more about the disturbances. She and Kathleen
began to watch for the camp station wagon,
and ten minutes later, saw its headlights wink in
signal from the main road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
“Goodbye, Aunt Mattie,” Judy said, giving her
a hasty peck on the cheek. “If anything should go
wrong tonight, you’ll call me at Pine Cone Camp?”</p>

<p>“I’ll call the police,” Miss Meadows threatened.
“Now run along, and enjoy yourselves.”</p>

<p>Enroute back to camp, Judy and Kathleen did
not report their experience at Calico Cottage. During
the drive up the mountain, they were somewhat
silent, but the others took it for granted that the two
girls were worn out from the day’s hike.</p>

<p>In truth, Judy was very tired. Even before the
“lights out” signal, she was snug in her cot, with the
warm blankets tucked around her ears.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I could sleep until noon tomorrow,”
she murmured drowsily. “Is there any law, I wonder,
about skipping breakfast, and staying in bed?”</p>

<p>If there was an answer to her question, Judy did
not hear it. She fell into a sound slumber, lulled by
the chirp of crickets.</p>

<p>Sometime toward morning, Judy began to dream.
A confusion of images flitted through her mind. She
thought she was exploring a cave, that the White
Witch had come alive and was advancing toward
her in a menacing manner.</p>

<p>In her dream, she became aware of a horrible
odor. The scent enveloped her, stifling her so that
she could not breathe.</p>

<p>Awakening, Judy found herself battling the blankets
which she had pulled up over her head. She
laughed in relief. The White Witch was only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
nightmare! There was no disagreeable odor&mdash;or was
there?</p>

<p>Thrusting the covers aside, Judy sat up in bed.
Fearfully, she sniffed the air. The odor had not been
entirely in her dream! The air was chilly, filled with
an acrid scent she could not identify immediately.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, Judy knew. She bolted out of
bed, the cold chills racing down her spine. The tent
was filled with smoke! The camp must be afire!</p>

<h2><a name="xvii" id="xvii"></a><i>Chapter 17</i><br />
<span>SMOKE IN THE WOODS</span></h2>

<p class="noi">THOROUGHLY alert now, Judy awakened her
tent mates, warning them of the danger.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” mumbled Ardeth, drugged by
sleep and unwilling to leave her comfortable cot.</p>

<p>“Get out of here fast, unless you want to be
burned!” Judy said tersely, giving her a hard shake.
“The forest is on fire!”</p>

<p>The other Beaver Patrol Scouts who shared the
tent, already were out of bed and dressing with
frenzied haste. Judy pulled on her own clothes,
aware that more and more smoke was swirling
about the canvas shelter.</p>

<p>Once outside, she saw the source of the fire.
Heavy black smoke was billowing toward the camp
from the woods where duff and debris were ablaze.</p>

<p>Judy’s first moment of relief that camp buildings
and tents were intact, gave way to concern. The
surface fire was dangerously close. Fed by a light
but steady wind, the flames were moving toward
the camp with amazing speed!</p>

<p>As she started for the adjoining tents to awaken
the girls there, a gong in the main dining room
sounded the first alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Bong! Bong! Bong!</p>

<p>Tent flaps went apart, and sleep-eyed Scouts began
to thrust tousled heads out into the cold night
air.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” demanded Beverly, one of the first
Beaver Patrol girls to scramble into her clothes. “Is
the camp afire?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but it will be if we don’t work fast!”
Judy asserted. “Oh!”</p>

<p>She uttered a little scream as a flying brand,
borne by the wind, dropped in the grass only a few
feet away.</p>

<p>Badly frightened, she and Beverly ran to stamp
out the tiny flames.</p>

<p>By this time, the camp was in confusion. Scouts
were pouring out of their tents, milling about, chattering
excitedly.</p>

<p>Unit leaders quickly gained control of the situation,
ordering everyone to the main lodge assembly
room.</p>

<p>Miss Lubell spoke tersely to the girls.</p>

<p>“Now there is no cause for alarm,” she advised
everyone. “The fire is very close to our camp, and
the wind is in this direction, but rangers are on
their way here. I notified them by telephone. The
fire already had been spotted from the observation
tower.”</p>

<p>“Will we have to evacuate the camp?” inquired
Miss Ward.</p>

<p>“That depends entirely upon whether or not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
fire quickly can be brought under control,” the
camp director replied. “So far, it is not wide-spread,
but the head is moving in this direction.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we do anything until the rangers come?”
Judy interposed.</p>

<p>“We can,” Miss Lubell said. “We can’t hope to
fight the fire, but we can take steps to keep it under
control. Each unit is to report to its leader and follow
her orders. We’ll wet down the tents and the
buildings to protect them from flying sparks. Then
we’ll make a fire break by clearing a ditch ahead of
the spreading flames!”</p>

<p>Pouring out of the assembly hall, the Beaver Patrol
Scouts clustered about their unit leader and
Miss Ward. Under direction, they carried buckets
of water from the lake, dousing the walls of their
tents thoroughly.</p>

<p>To be prepared for a quick evacuation, in the
event one was ordered, they hastily tossed their belongings
into suitcases.</p>

<p>This done, they raced to the edge of the camp, to
assist counselors, who frantically had started to dig
a shallow trench or fire break.</p>

<p>Using garden hoes, rakes, spades and other implements
at hand, the Scouts rapidly cleared a band
several feet wide between the camp and the spreading
ground fire.</p>

<p>A few sparks were flying, but those which
dropped in dry grass, instantly were extinguished
by a unit assigned to that particular task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
By this time, the wind had spread the fire into an
elliptical shape. Inexorably, it crept nearer and
nearer the trench the girls were digging.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be nip and tuck to save the camp,”
Miss Lubell gasped. “Don’t give up, girls!”</p>

<p>Against the flames, trees were silhouetted as dark,
towering shapes. The sight was a terrifying one.
But even though they could feel the heat in their
faces, the Scouts kept doggedly at work.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a cry went up.</p>

<p>“The rangers!” cried a Lone Tree Scout. “They’ve
come!”</p>

<p>Judy drew a deep, tired sigh of relief as she saw
the Forest Service truck roll in with fire-fighting
equipment.</p>

<p>“Our job is done now,” Miss Lubell said, wiping
a smudge from her cheek. “We’ll let the men take
over. Everyone report in the assembly room.”</p>

<p>The Scouts all checked in, and after washing up,
watched the crew of rangers attack the fire.</p>

<p>A tractor widened and completed the ditch
started by the Scouts. This task accomplished, rangers
beat out some of the flames which had jumped
the “break,” and hooked up a power pump.</p>

<p>Sleep was out of the question for the excited
Scouts. They kept in orderly groups, but remained
at the assembly room windows, watching every
phase of the efficient fire fighting work.</p>

<p>The Beaver Patrol girls, those of the Lone Tree
unit, and the Oriole outfit, volunteered to help in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the kitchen. Gallons of coffee were prepared for the
rangers.</p>

<p>“We’ve made enough for an army of workers!”
Judy laughed.</p>

<p>The beverage was kept hot, ready to serve whenever
a tired fire fighter could leave his post.</p>

<p>By four o’clock, the rangers announced that the
fire finally was under complete control. Relaxing a
bit from their arduous labors, the men took turns
dropping around at the kitchen for coffee and a
sandwich.</p>

<p>Arthur Wentz, one of the first rangers to come,
praised the Scouts warmly for their well organized
efforts prior to the arrival of the forest service truck.</p>

<p>“This could have been a bad fire,” he remarked.
“There are three types&mdash;surface, ground and crown.
But all start as surface fires.”</p>

<p>Judy asked the ranger to distinguish between the
different classifications.</p>

<p>“Surface fires, as the name implies, burn only the
loose debris on top of the ground,” he explained.
“That’s the type of thing we encountered here.
Sometimes, the fire eats down into the layer of undecomposed
material on the forest floor, and then
you have a ground fire. The most difficult of all are
those which spread into the trees, or the crown
fires.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose this one started?” Miss
Ward asked the ranger.</p>

<p>“That’s hard to say,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Lowell Diethelm, the ranger Judy had met in the
village the previous evening, now tramped into the
kitchen. He had overheard Miss Ward’s question
and the reply.</p>

<p>“It’s plain enough how the fire started,” he commented,
pouring himself a mug of coffee.</p>

<p>“How?” Judy asked.</p>

<p>“Someone from this camp has been careless about
fire.”</p>

<p>A stunned silence followed the observation. Then,
almost as a unit, the Girl Scouts began to protest.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s fair to say!” exclaimed Kathleen
indignantly. “Do you have any proof that the
fire was started by anyone in this camp?”</p>

<p>“No proof,” the ranger admitted. “Just circumstantial
evidence. You girls had a cook-out last
night?”</p>

<p>“We started a fire at Fountain Falls,” Judy said.
“You knew about that. We put it out too!”</p>

<p>“Anyway, that’s miles from here!” Betty Bashe
broke in. “This fire started close to our camp.”</p>

<p>“Exactly my point,” replied Diethelm. “Any other
cook-outs last night?”</p>

<p>“Our unit had one,” spoke up a Scout from the
Lone Tree patrol. “We were accompanied by our
leaders though, and built our fire on a rock. Every
spark was extinguished before we left the spot.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you thought,” Diethelm said, none
too pleasantly. “I’m not saying the Scouts started
this fire, but I do say, it looks rather suspicious. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the fire hadn’t been reported so quickly, the entire
camp might have burned.”</p>

<p>“That’s for sure,” agreed Arthur Wentz. “But I
think you’re being unjust to the girls, Lowell. The
fire may have been started by a carelessly dropped
cigarette or a match. Or it could have been deliberately
set.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Diethelm demanded, startled.</p>

<p>“Just a little thought I had,” Wentz replied with
an odd smile.</p>

<p>Diethelm seemed to have been made uncomfortable
by the remark and pursued the subject no further.
He gulped down his coffee and soon left the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Don’t take what he said too seriously,” Wentz
told the Scouts. “This camp has a good record. No
one knows how the fire started.”</p>

<p>“I can assure you that it was not touched off by
any of our girls,” asserted Miss Lubell firmly.
“We’ve taken every precaution against fire.”</p>

<p>Although heavy smoke still hung over the camp
area, the flames no longer were spreading. A ranger
was assigned to remain behind to watch the smoldering
debris. The others loaded their truck and
presently drove away.</p>

<p>Worn out by their strenuous activities, the Scouts
returned to their cots to try to snatch a few winks
of sleep before dawn. Their eyes smarted, but tired
as they were, they were too excited to relax. Most
of the girls were relieved when the gong sounded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
a signal for them to dress again and assemble for
breakfast.</p>

<p>Great quantities of hot chocolate, scrambled eggs,
toast and fruit, brought cheer to the Scouts. Nevertheless,
the main topic at the table was the unjust
accusation which Lowell Diethelm had leveled at
the organization.</p>

<p>“I’ve never liked that ranger,” Judy remarked to
Virginia, who sat beside her. “I guess it’s mean to
say, because a Girl Scout should try to like folks,
but there’s something about him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” nodded Virginia,
reaching for another piece of toast. “He doesn’t
seem friendly as the other rangers do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get over what happened today about
that trucker,” Judy went on, thinking aloud. “Suppose
I was right, and Diethelm was mistaken&mdash;”</p>

<p>She broke off then, for Miss Ward had come into
the dining hall, and was signaling to her.</p>

<p>“Judy, you’re wanted at the telephone,” the
teacher called. “Your aunt, I think.”</p>

<p>Judy went quickly to Miss Lubell’s office. The
call must be important, she reasoned, else her aunt
would not have phoned at such an early morning
hour. She was afraid Aunt Mattie had learned of
the fire and was alarmed for her safety. Either that,
or the ghost of Calico Cottage had put in another
appearance!</p>

<p>As she took down the receiver, her first fears were
confirmed. Miss Meadows was in a great state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
agitation, having been informed that a fire was raging
at Pine Cone Camp.</p>

<p>“It was only a little fire, and it never reached our
camp,” Judy explained patiently. “Now don’t worry
one tiny bit, Aunt Mattie! Everything is all right
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a relief,” Miss Meadows sighed. “I
confess, I’ve spent a dreadful night.”</p>

<p>“No more disturbances, I hope.”</p>

<p>“It depends upon what you mean by disturbances,”
Miss Meadows returned stiffly. “There were
no weird sounds from the basement. But other
things happened.”</p>

<p>“What sort of things?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you over the telephone,” Miss Meadows
answered. “Just come as quickly as you can
to the cottage!”</p>

<p>And with that, she hung up the receiver.</p>

<span>AN URGENT CALL</span></h2>

<p class="noi">IT was well after seven o’clock when Judy, accompanied
by Kathleen, arrived at Calico Cottage.</p>

<p>The trip down the mountain in the station wagon
had not been without excitement. Less than a half
mile from the cottage, the driver had been halted
by state patrolmen, who had set up a road block.</p>

<p>At first, the girls had assumed that motorists on
the main highway were being stopped because of
the fire which still smoldered in the Pine Cone
Camp area. Therefore, it came as a surprise to learn
that the road block had been set up for an entirely
different purpose.</p>

<p>The state highway patrolman informed them that
a truckload of auto parts had been hi-jacked during
the night on a lonely stretch of road between the
towns of Silverton and Grove City, some miles
away. The truck was known to have followed the
mountain road, making for the state line, yet had
seemed to disappear into thin air.</p>

<p>“Somehow those birds get wind of where our
road blocks are set up,” the highway patrolman had
said. “The hi-jackers have a hide-out. When we’re
not on their trail, they slip off the road somewhere
and wait until the coast is clear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
The bold tactics of the hi-jackers were of intense
interest to the girls because of their own meeting
with two of the men believed to be members of the
gang.</p>

<p>Nor had Judy erased from her mind the fact that
only a few hours earlier, she had seen the man she
believed to be Joe Pompilli.</p>

<p>She was reflecting upon the matter as the station
wagon driver let the girls off at Calico Cottage.
Why, she wondered, had Lowell Diethelm been so
certain that she was mistaken in the identification?</p>

<p>“He seemed honest enough in thinking that the
man was a regular trucker on the road,” she
thought. “But if I were right, and Diethelm made
a mistake&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her reflections were interrupted by Kathleen,
who nudged her in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Why so sober, Judy?”</p>

<p>“I was just speculating on those hi-jackers,
Kathy,” Judy replied as they started across the dew-laden
lawn. “I’m more than half convinced that we
made a bad mistake last night.”</p>

<p>“You think we let Joe Pompilli get away?”</p>

<p>“We must have. Kathy, he and that other fellow
we didn’t know, may have been killing time at the
restaurant, waiting for that truckload of auto parts
to go through town! Then, they merely followed,
and picked the truck off at a convenient spot on the
road.”</p>

<p>“That makes a nice sounding explanation,” Kathleen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
chuckled. “But there’s one bad flaw in your
reasoning.”</p>

<p>“Two of ’em,” Judy admitted with a grin. “First,
it doesn’t seem logical that Joe Pompilli would
dare show up in this area when he must know that
state highway patrolmen are on the alert.”</p>

<p>“He was badly hurt in that accident too,” Kathleen
added.</p>

<p>“Maybe not as seriously as we thought. The other
defect in my theory is that Lowell Diethelm positively
identified him as a regular trucker on the
road.”</p>

<p>“That’s the part one can’t get around,” Kathleen
nodded soberly. “Either the patrolmen made a
mistake in identifying an ordinary trucker as Joe
Pompilli, or Lowell Diethelm has been misled.”</p>

<p>“In either case, I guess it’s too late for us to do
anything about it now,” Judy admitted. “We had
our chance, and we muffed it.”</p>

<p>Walking carefully so that they would not soak
their shoes with the heavy dew, the girls tramped
across the lawn to the back door of Calico Cottage.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows, who had seen them coming, flung
open the door.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed to have telephoned you,” she apologized.
“Have you had breakfast?”</p>

<p>“An early one,” Judy replied as she and Kathleen
entered the warm kitchen. “If those are muffins I
smell, we can eat another one though!”</p>

<p>“Blueberry muffins,” Miss Meadows smiled, peeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
into the oven. “You arrived at just the right
time, for they’ll be done in three minutes.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie, why did you send such an urgent
telephone message?” Judy asked abruptly. “You
said it wasn’t the ghost again.”</p>

<p>“No, the basement was quiet enough last night.”</p>

<p>“Then what did happen?”</p>

<p>“I know you think I’m nervous and silly&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No such thing, Aunt Mattie.”</p>

<p>“It was those lights that bothered me again. Now
that it’s morning, I feel much better about it. But
last night, and until after I telephoned, I felt so
jittery.”</p>

<p>“Lights on the private road?” Judy questioned.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows did not answer until after she had
removed the muffins from the oven. Then she said:</p>

<p>“I awoke about two o’clock, I’d judge. I can’t explain
it, but I had a strong feeling that something
was wrong. I lay there in bed for awhile, listening.
I could hear the muffled rumble of a big truck engine.”</p>

<p>“Nothing so unusual about that, Aunt Mattie. A
great many trucks pass on the main highway, even
at night.”</p>

<p>“This truck didn’t pass,” Miss Meadows said impressively.
“I saw the lights flash past my bedroom
window. Because I was nervous and couldn’t sleep,
I got up and looked out. I saw the truck stop, and
the lights went off. Then the truck turned down that
old road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Judy and Kathleen had listened attentively to
Miss Meadows’ account. They exchanged a quick
glance but remained silent.</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no occasion to be bothered
about a truck turning down a private road,” Judy’s
aunt chattered on. “It shouldn’t worry me, I know.
But I kept imagining all sorts of things, wondering
if those men might be hi-jackers.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Mattie, we don’t consider you one bit silly
to be nervous about it,” Judy said quickly. “You
didn’t telephone the state highway patrol?”</p>

<p>“No, I thought of it, but after all, I didn’t know
but what the trucks had a right to be on that road.
It could have been loggers?”</p>

<p>“How long did the truck remain on the private
road?” Judy asked.</p>

<p>“So far as I know, it’s still there. I set up and
watched until dawn. Since then, I’ve been rather
busy.”</p>

<p>“If the truck is still on that road, we should
check&mdash;” Kathleen suggested quickly.</p>

<p>“I think we should,” Miss Meadows agreed. “I’d
have done it myself, only to tell you the truth, I
was afraid to go alone.”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t be?” Judy backed her up. “When
do we start? Right now?”</p>

<p>“No, finish your breakfast first,” Miss Meadows
urged. “Such nice muffins shouldn’t be wasted.”</p>

<p>Their thoughts on the investigation before them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Judy and Kathleen ate quickly. Miss Meadows
apologized for not having any milk to offer.</p>

<p>“I ran out yesterday,” she remarked, “and the
new milkman always comes very late.”</p>

<p>“The new milkman?” Judy repeated, nearly dropping
her knife. “What became of Bart?”</p>

<p>“I understand he’s given up his job. The new man
told me that Bart quit because of something special
he wanted to do before the start of college.”</p>

<p>“Something special,” mused Judy. “You know
what I think! Bart quit so he could thoroughly explore
Calico Cave!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I hope not,” Miss Meadows murmured.
“That sounds frightfully dangerous. You don’t think
he’d explore very far alone?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” replied Judy. “From the little
Bart said to me, I’m sure he hopes to solve the mystery
of what became of his father. To do that, he’d
have to brave the siphon.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! I never heard of anything so reckless!”
Miss Meadows gasped. “Why, the authorities
shouldn’t allow it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t imagine Bart told anyone of his plan,”
Judy answered. “He’s thoroughly familiar with the
cave, and it would be safe enough for him to explore,
providing he didn’t try to go through the
siphon.”</p>

<p>“Just what is a siphon?” Kathleen inquired.</p>

<p>“As I understand it, a siphon is a tunnel through
the cave, with a submerged ceiling. If one were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
good swimmer, as Bart apparently is, one might
dive and swim through it to open air on the other
side.”</p>

<p>“That’s assuming that the tunnel wasn’t very
long,” Miss Meadows commented.</p>

<p>“True,” Judy nodded. “It would be a terrifying
experience. Only a very courageous and foolhardy
explorer would attempt it.”</p>

<p>“Bart’s just the type to risk it!” Kathleen asserted.
“I wonder when he plans to tackle the siphon?”</p>

<p>“From what the new milkman told me, he may be
in the cave even now!” Miss Meadows said with a
shudder. “The mere thought of it frightens me.”</p>

<p>“Bart knows how to take care of himself,” Judy
declared to relieve her aunt’s mind somewhat. “I’m
sure he does.”</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Miss Meadows hastily cleared
away the few dishes which had been used. She refused
to let the girls wash them, insisting that she
would stack them in the sink for a good soaking.</p>

<p>“Let’s explore the road to the cave now,” she
urged. “I’ll feel much better if I satisfy myself that
everything is all right.”</p>

<p>“We could call the Forest Service or one of the
state highway patrolmen, if you’d rather,” Kathleen
proposed.</p>

<p>“If the truck shouldn’t be there, or if it had a right
to be, I’d never live down the mistake I’d made,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Miss Meadows said. “No, I’d prefer to do a bit of
checking for myself first.”</p>

<p>She put on her heavy jacket as protection against
the morning chill, and locked all the doors. The
three then crossed the main highway and turned
down the narrow rutty dirt road.</p>

<p>The sun was showing itself through the tall trees,
as the explorers made their way down the steep
slope. Almost at once, Miss Meadows triumphantly
pointed to heavy tire tracks on the roadbed.</p>

<p>“See, I was right!” she exclaimed. “Those tire
marks show that a big truck went down this road
last night.”</p>

<p>“Apparently only in one direction too,” Judy
agreed. “This road dead-ends, so either the truck
had to turn around and come back, or it’s still down
there somewhere.”</p>

<p>Quickening their pace, but becoming very quiet,
the three moved on.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the end of the road.</p>

<p>“No truck here!” Kathleen exclaimed, halting.</p>

<p>“Here’s where it made a turn,” Judy said, pointing
to deep tire marks in the road and grass.</p>

<p>Then she saw the truck itself. It had been driven
entirely off the road and parked in a thick clump of
bushes behind a shield of trees. Even so, the massive
vehicle was only partially hidden from view.</p>

<p>While Kathleen and Miss Meadows waited
tensely, Judy cautiously crept through the bushes
to obtain a closer glimpse of the big truck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
The cab was deserted. Had the truck run out of
gas perhaps, or was it being hidden there to escape
detection?</p>

<p>Judy was quite certain she knew the answer, but
to confirm her suspicions, she circled the transport.
At the rear, she tried the big double doors which
gave access to the cargo. They were locked.</p>

<p>Unable to learn more, she returned to report to
her aunt and Kathleen.</p>

<p>“I’m convinced this is the truck that the highway
patrolmen want to stop,” she informed them. “After
the road blocks have been removed, the hi-jackers
may be able to slip out of here and get safely
away!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, they won’t!” announced Miss Meadows
with grim determination. “We’ll tip off the state
highway headquarters! I’ll telephone.”</p>

<p>“Someone should stay here to keep watch,” Judy
said. “The driver may return at any minute and try
to pull out.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Miss Meadows agreed. “I&mdash;I guess
I’d better stay, while you girls telephone.”</p>

<p>“No, you go to Calico Cottage,” Judy urged.
“Kathleen and I will wait here.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid?”</p>

<p>“No, you’ll have help here in just a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hurry as fast as I can,” Miss Meadows promised,
starting away. “Get into the bushes, and keep
out of sight until I’m back here with the law!”</p>

<span>THE HIDE-OUT</span></h2>

<p class="noi">LEFT alone, Judy and Kathleen crept into the
thicket at the left hand side of the road. The air
was damp and chilly and leaves dripped moisture.
In a very few minutes, the girls began to weary of
crouching in such uncomfortable positions.</p>

<p>“That truck driver must have skipped out,” Kathleen
muttered. “It’s sort of silly to hide here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Judy replied, keeping her voice
low.</p>

<p>“I wish we knew where the driver went.” Disregarding
caution, Kathleen straightened up from her
crouched position and carefully looked about.</p>

<p>She could see a portion of the trail which led toward
Calico Cave. As she stood thus, a little dog
came into view, trotting from the direction of the
cavern.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Pete!” Kathleen exclaimed, speaking
much louder than she had intended. “Do you suppose
Bart is somewhere near, or in the cave?”</p>

<p>“He must be,” Judy agreed. She added in warning:
“But do quiet down. If we keep sounding off,
we’ll give our hiding place away to anyone who
comes along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
“Pete is onto it now!” Kathleen agreed in dismay.</p>

<p>The little dog had halted alertly on the trail.
After sniffing the air, he left the path and came directly
over to the bushes where the two girls had
taken shelter.</p>

<p>To their consternation, he began to bark and to
jerk his head, as if inviting them to follow him to
the cave.</p>

<p>Judy seized the little dog, and tightly held his
jaws so that he could not bark.</p>

<p>“This is a fine howdy-do!” she muttered. “Pete
will give us away if anyone is within a mile of here!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Bart could be close?” Kathleen
speculated. “Pete plainly is trying to get us to follow
him to the cave.”</p>

<p>“If we let him go, he’ll set up a fearful clatter. I
can’t hold his jaws together forever either!”</p>

<p>“Bart would be a big help to us if we could find
him.”</p>

<p>“We could see if he’s at the cave entrance,” Judy
said reluctantly. “I don’t think we’ll find him
though, and we’d be leaving a good hiding place.”</p>

<p>“We can be careful,” Kathleen returned. “Help
from the Forest Service or highway headquarters
should be coming quite soon.”</p>

<p>Allowing herself to be persuaded, Judy followed
Kathleen from the leafy shelter. She kept tight hold
of Pete however, not allowing him to bark or scramble
out of her arms.</p>

<p>The rocky path wound through the trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
around big boulders. Presently, the girls were within
view of the dark entranceway to the cave.</p>

<p>Judy halted, thinking that she saw a tiny wisp
of smoke emerging from the cavern. In that moment
of inattention, Pete made a convulsive movement
and before she could regain her grip, leaped
to the ground.</p>

<p>Yipping excitedly, he ran toward the cave entrance.</p>

<p>With a gasp of dismay, Judy thrust Kathleen
back into a thicket, and herself crouched behind a
rock.</p>

<p>It was well that the girls took refuge, for Pete’s
loud barking had not gone unheard.</p>

<p>A dark figure appeared silhouetted in the opening
of the cave. Judy could not see the face of the
heavy-set man, but she knew instantly from his
build that he was not Bart Ranieau.</p>

<p>“There’s that confounded mutt again!” the girls
heard the man exclaim. “He’ll give us away!”</p>

<p>“Slug him with a rock!” came advice from inside
the cave.</p>

<p>The man in the entranceway, heaved a stone
which missed its mark by mere inches. Pete barked
the louder.</p>

<p>“Put a bullet through him,” was the next gruff
advice.</p>

<p>“Don’t dare,” the girls heard the reply. “A shot
would be heard too far.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t get out of this hole pretty soon, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
dog will have the whole town down on us,” the other
growled. “Quiet him somehow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t pay any attention to him and he’ll shut
up,” the first man said. “If we can coax him in here,
I’ll wring his neck!”</p>

<p>Pete did stop barking after a few more excited
yips, but canine caution kept him from going closer
to the cave. In vain the two men tried to coax him
into the cavern. Pete lay flat on his belly on the
path and whined.</p>

<p>Finally, they abandoned the effort to get him inside,
and themselves moved back out of view in the
darkness.</p>

<p>For a long while, Judy and Kathleen remained
motionless, afraid to stir lest they disclose their
presence. Both were convinced that the two men in
the cave were the hi-jackers, and that they merely
were waiting there until they safely could move
out their truck and stolen cargo.</p>

<p>“We can’t stay here,” Judy finally whispered to
her chum. “Let’s make a break for it. If we’re seen,
we’ll have to run for our lives.”</p>

<p>Moving stealthily, the girls slipped from their
hiding place.</p>

<p>Pete saw them go and cocked his head attentively.
But to their intense relief, he did not bark
or try to follow them.</p>

<p>Safely, the girls retraced their way to the private
road.</p>

<p>Once there, Judy anxiously looked up the slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
for a glimpse of her aunt or the assistance which
she hoped would come.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to hide in the bushes again,”
Kathleen proposed. “Pete may ferret us out too.”</p>

<p>As the girls debated what action to take, Judy
saw that a green coupe had turned down the private
road.</p>

<p>“A Forest Service car!” she exclaimed, over-joyed.
“Good Aunt Mattie! She must have put through
a fast telephone call to the ranger station. Our
troubles are over!”</p>

<p>“I thought your aunt intended to call the highway
patrol headquarters,” Kathleen commented,
watching the approaching car with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“Maybe she called ’em both. At any rate, a forest
ranger is just what the doctor ordered!”</p>

<p>Judy rushed out to meet the approaching automobile,
waving her arms to attract attention.</p>

<p>The car drew up with a slight squeak of brakes.
Judy saw then that the driver was Lowell Diethelm,
and he seemed as surprised to see her and Kathleen
as they were to encounter him on the lonely road.</p>

<p>“Did Aunt Mattie reach you?” Judy demanded.</p>

<p>The ranger’s startled expression disclosed that he
did not know what she was talking about.</p>

<p>“I guess Aunt Mattie hasn’t had time to get word
through,” Judy went on. “Anyway, you’re here in
time to nab those hi-jackers!”</p>

<p>She and Kathleen then breathlessly told of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
suspicions, and pointed out the big truck which
had been hidden in the thicket.</p>

<p>In their anxiety to tell the story clearly and fast,
neither girl noticed that Diethelm was watching
them in an odd sort of way, but not asking many
questions.</p>

<p>When Judy finally ran out of breath, the ranger
motioned for the two girls to get into the coupe.</p>

<p>“But aren’t you going to do anything about it?”
Judy demanded. “Don’t you intend to find out if
those men hiding in the cave are hi-jackers?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I intend to do something about it,” Diethelm
drawled, “but I’m not foolhardy. We’re up
against a tough gang. There may be shooting. I
need reenforcements.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” Judy agreed. Her gaze fell
upon the radio equipment in the ranger’s car.
“Couldn’t you call the ranger station?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Diethelm said again. “Sure. Come on, get
in, and I’ll take care of it.”</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen obeyed, sliding in beside the
ranger. He turned the car around in the narrow
roadway, heading it toward the main highway.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you up the hill,” he said. “It’s safer
that way. Then if there should be shooting, you’ll
be all right.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we get word to the ranger station right
away?” Judy urged again. “Those men may decide
to try to pull out of here any minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
“Take it easy,” Diethelm advised. “Let me handle
this, will you?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Judy mumbled. “I didn’t mean to suggest&mdash;only&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Judy replied shortly.</p>

<p>Diethelm reached across, snapping a lock on the
door of the coupe. The gesture seemed careless
enough. Yet, why should he have reason to lock the
automobile? Judy, suddenly uneasy, glanced at
Kathleen and saw that her chum looked frightened.</p>

<p>“So your aunt is telephoning the state highway
patrol station?” the ranger remarked easily. “How
long ago was that?”</p>

<p>“Five&mdash;maybe ten minutes ago,” Judy answered.
She was trying hard to smother the suspicion which
had formed in her mind.</p>

<p>“Your aunt went to the cottage to phone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Judy hesitated and then said earnestly:
“Won’t you please call ranger headquarters now on
your radio telephone? It’s important to get help
fast. Aunt Mattie may have failed to get her call
through.”</p>

<p>Diethelm smiled and flipped a switch on the
radio. He fumbled with it as he drove efficiently
with one hand.</p>

<p>“Car 23 to Headquarters. Car 23 to Headquarters,”
he called.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Diethelm,” came the order from headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
“Nothing to report, sir. No fires sighted.”</p>

<p>“Any sign of the hi-jackers? They’re reported to
have headed into your patrol area.”</p>

<p>Diethelm spoke clearly and in a detached manner.
“No sign of ’em anywhere,” he replied. “Inform
the highway patrol, they may as well lift the road
block. That’s right, sir. I’ve checked the area thoroughly.
No sign of ’em.”</p>

<span>TREACHERY</span></h2>

<p class="noi">JUDY and Kathleen scarcely could believe that
they had heard the ranger’s radio message correctly.</p>

<p>For a stunned moment, they sat in dead silence,
unable to comprehend what had transpired.</p>

<p>Diethelm wore the inconspicuous pine tree badge
of the forest rangers, but he had never seemed
friendly or helpful as had the other Forest Service
men.</p>

<p>Judy had sensed the man’s antagonism almost
from the first moment of their meeting. Until this
night, however, she had never actually distrusted
him.</p>

<p>Now, as the meaning of his message to headquarters
penetrated her brain, she realized that he
deliberately had given false information to his superior
officers. Information which would aid the hi-jackers,
who awaited the lifting of the road block
to rush their stolen cargo across the state line!</p>

<p>As the car climbed the steep incline, Kathleen
suddenly reached for the door handle.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that!” Diethelm ordered sharply.
“Stay in this car!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
“You’re making us prisoners?” Kathleen gasped,
shaken by the ranger’s treachery.</p>

<p>“You asked for this,” Diethelm retorted. “If you’d
kept to your own affairs, no one would have bothered
you. Now you’ve poked your pretty little noses
in, you’ll have to take the consequences!”</p>

<p>“Which are&mdash;?” interposed Judy. She was no
longer frightened, but smoldered with a deep, burning
anger.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you some distance from here and dump
you in the woods,” Diethelm informed her. “By
the time you find your way out, we’ll be over the
state line. This is our last haul.”</p>

<p>“So you’re one of the hi-jackers!” Kathleen accused
shrilly. “A disgrace to the ranger uniform!”</p>

<p>“I’ve not been in the service long,” Diethelm said.
“It means nothing to me. I adopted the uniform
only to serve my own purpose. For six months it’s
been a cinch to run cargo through, but lately the
state highway patrol has bottled up most of the
roads. We’ll move on to another state.”</p>

<p>The car had reached the main highway. Judy
could see Calico Cottage through the morning mist,
but there was no sign of her aunt, or of any help.</p>

<p>Everything was painfully clear now! The trucker
she and Kathleen had seen the previous night at the
restaurant, had indeed been Joe Pompilli. Either he,
or his runners now were at the cave, awaiting a
chance to slip their cargo over the state line. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
with the road block soon to be lifted, that chance
might come very soon!</p>

<p>The coupe turned onto the main highway, and
started up the winding mountain road. Judy saw
Diethelm glance anxiously at the gasoline gauge.</p>

<p>Her pulse leaped with hope, for she saw that the
pointer already stood on the empty mark, and was
giving only an occasional convulsive jerk.</p>

<p>“We’re about out of gas,” Diethelm muttered.</p>

<p>“No filling stations on this road for three miles,”
Judy said in satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We rangers have supply caches,” Diethelm
dashed her hopes again. “My own private one is
just ahead.”</p>

<p>A few hundred yards farther up the road, he
pulled off onto the right-of-way. Back among the
trees, Judy and Kathleen saw the gasoline supply
tank, marked with the Forest Service name.</p>

<p>Diethelm reached for a can on the floor behind
the seat. As he got out of the car, he tapped the
revolver in his holster.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you move or try to get out of this
car!” he ordered. “I’ll have my eye on you. I’m
warning that if you try to escape, I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>Diethelm then strode to the gasoline storage tank,
hurriedly starting to fill his can.</p>

<p>“Lean forward&mdash;block off the window, so he
can’t see me,” Judy instructed Kathleen tersely.</p>

<p>“He’s watching us. If we try to get out, I’m afraid
he’ll carry out his threat to shoot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
“We can’t hope to get away,” Judy admitted.
“But there’s one outside chance we can get through
to ranger headquarters on the radio phone. I’m
going to risk it.”</p>

<p>Now that she knew her friend’s scheme, Kathleen
obediently shifted her position, so that her back
temporarily shielded Judy from view.</p>

<p>In an instant, Judy had snapped the radio phone
on.</p>

<p>“Car 23 to Headquarters!” she called excitedly
into the transmitter. “Emergency call! Emergency
call!”</p>

<p>“Headquarters to Car 23,” came the reply. “Who
the deuce is this? Diethelm&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m a Girl Scout&mdash;held a prisoner in Diethelm’s
car,” Judy broke in. Aware that Diethelm himself
had dropped the gasoline can and was striding toward
the coupe, her words tumbled over each other
in her haste to get them out. “The hi-jackers are at
the cave! Their truck&mdash;”</p>

<p>The car door was jerked open at that point, and
the radio phone ripped from Judy’s hand. Diethelm
clicked the switch off, pulling the girl bodily
from the coupe.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” he snarled, shoving her
so hard that she fell to the ground. “Little fool!”</p>

<p>Despite his previous threat, Diethelm did not
touch his revolver. His face contorted by worry,
he seemed uncertain what to do for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Tersely then, he ordered Kathleen out of the
car also.</p>

<p>“Turn your backs and start walking into the
woods,” he ordered the two girls. “Keep walking.
Don’t look back or I’ll shoot.”</p>

<p>Kathleen pulled Judy to her feet, and they slowly
moved off into the woods.</p>

<p>“Walk faster!” Diethelm shouted.</p>

<p>The girls obediently increased their speed, stumbling
as they climbed over fallen logs and other
forest debris.</p>

<p>Moments passed, and Judy dared to look over
her shoulder. No longer could she see the car or
the roadway.</p>

<p>But as she paused, she heard the roar of the
coupe’s engine.</p>

<p>“He’s filled the gas tank and he’s pulling out!”
she declared. “Now to get help, if we can.”</p>

<p>Hurrying back the way they had come, the girls
reached the roadside in time to see the coupe disappearing
around a curve in the direction from
which it had come.</p>

<p>“He’s going back to the cave to warn the hi-jackers!”
Judy guessed shrewdly. “He must know I
got through to the ranger headquarters!”</p>

<p>“Then that means that the hi-jackers probably
will try to move their truck out now!” Kathleen
exclaimed. “They may make it too, because it isn’t
far to the state line and the road block probably has
been lifted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
“We must stop them somehow! Let’s get back
to Calico Cottage as fast as we can!”</p>

<p>They pounded down the road, hoping as they
ran that a car would come along. None did. In
Diethelm’s coupe, the distance they had traveled
from the junction with the private road had seemed
very short. Now, the reverse was true.</p>

<p>Though the distance could not be more than a
third of a mile, it seemed endless to the two Scouts.
Alternately running and dog-trotting, they finally
reached Calico Cottage, winded and perspiring.</p>

<p>As they crossed the yard, Miss Meadows came
to meet them.</p>

<p>“I’ve had such a time,” she began. “At first, I
couldn’t get my call through. Why, what’s happened?”</p>

<p>Judy explained only briefly. She cut her story
short by demanding: “Aunt Mattie, how soon do
you think help will get here?”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes or longer. My call just went through.
Before that the line was busy, and I couldn’t get
the operator to understand that this was an emergency!”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes!” Judy groaned. “That will give
Diethelm all the time he needs to warn those men!”</p>

<p>“I saw a ranger car turn down the private road
quite awhile ago,” Miss Meadows contributed.</p>

<p>“That was Diethelm,” Judy said desperately.
“We’ve notified the ranger headquarters, but I
doubt they can get men here quickly enough either!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
“If only we could block the private road somehow,
so those hi-jackers can’t get their truck out!”
Kathleen exclaimed. “What could we use?”</p>

<p>Frantically, the three looked about the premises,
but not an object was available which would offer
an impediment to a powerful truck.</p>

<p>“The clothesline,” Miss Meadows suggested
doubtfully. “We could tie it to trees, across the
road.”</p>

<p>“It would snap in an instant,” Judy said. “I doubt
even a wire would delay them.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s nothing we can do,” Miss Meadows
said desperately. “Absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nails?” proposed Kathleen. “We could throw
them on the road and hope they’d spear the tires.”</p>

<p>“There’s a can of nails on the porch,” Miss Meadows
supplied eagerly. “The carpenter who must
have built this cottage, apparently left them.”</p>

<p>“It’s an idea,” Judy said slowly, “but it won’t
work. Those big truck tires would roll right over
the nails without a puncture. Not even glass would
cut them.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” Miss Meadows admitted,
crestfallen. “Oh, it’s hopeless.”</p>

<p>Judy, however, had a different idea. She was gazing
speculatively at the “Welcome” mat on the
doorstep.</p>

<p>“I think I know of a way to stop that truck if it
tries to come through!” she cried. “My scheme is
fantastic, but I’m sure it will work!”</p>

<h2><a name="xxi" id="xxi"></a><i>Chapter 21</i><br />
<span>TRUCKER’S WELCOME</span></h2>

<p class="noi">“HOW can we stop the truck if it tries to come
through?” Kathleen demanded eagerly. “What is
your idea, Judy?”</p>

<p>“You gave it to me yourself, when you mentioned
dropping nails on the road,” Judy answered. “That
wouldn’t do the trick, I’m sure, but I know what
will! This rubber door mat!”</p>

<p>She stooped to pick up the dusty “Welcome”
mat. As Kathleen and her aunt gazed at the object
in bewilderment, she hastened to reveal what she
had in mind.</p>

<p>“We can spear the nails through the mat so they’ll
stand upright! When the tires pass over them, they
can’t miss.”</p>

<p>“That should do it!” Miss Meadows approved.</p>

<p>“Judy, you’re a gem!” laughed Kathleen. “What
a brain!”</p>

<p>“No brain, just a memory,” Judy corrected. “I
recall hearing a filling station serviceman relate
how vandals once damaged big truck tires that way.
I’m sure it will work if we can do it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the nails,” Miss Meadows said, starting
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
In a moment she returned with an assortment in
a tin can. As fast as they could, the three punctured
the rubber mat, forcing the nails through so that
their sharp points were upright.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Judy suddenly.</p>

<p>She had heard the roar of a powerful motor
starting far down the private road.</p>

<p>“It’s the truck!” Kathleen exclaimed. “It’s coming,
and we don’t have half enough nails in this
mat!”</p>

<p>“There will be enough if the tires hit it,” Judy
declared. “The important thing is to get it placed,
and fast! Come on!”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Kathleen or her aunt, she
raced for the entrance to the private road.</p>

<p>She could not see the big truck which was hidden
by the curves of the rutty thoroughfare, but she
could tell from the roar of the engine, that it was
coming as fast as it could climb the steep slope.
Evidently, Diethelm had warned the hi-jackers,
and knowing that delay would be fatal, they were
making a run for it!</p>

<p>Judy had no time to deliberate where she would
lay the mat. She dropped it on the right hand side
of the road, directly across an old truck track.</p>

<p>If the driver saw the mat, he could swerve to
miss it. She was depending though upon the sharp
curve, figuring that the truck would come around
it fast, and that the big transport would roll over
the nails before they could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Kathleen and Miss Meadows already had screened
themselves behind the bushes lining the private
road. Judy scarcely had time to slide in beside them,
when the massive transport careened around the
curve.</p>

<p>The front wheel struck a deep rut and the truck
veered from the middle of the road.</p>

<p>“They’re going to miss it!” Kathleen moaned,
gripping Judy’s arm so hard that it hurt.</p>

<p>But the next moment, the driver brought the
truck back onto its course. Apparently, he had
failed to see the studded mat lying directly in the
path. Both front and rear tires rolled over the long,
sharp nails.</p>

<p>Breathlessly, the three watchers waited. Nothing
seemed to happen.</p>

<p>When the huge truck reached the entrance to
the private road, there was a loud hissing of air.
The transport began to wobble crazily. First the
front tire went down and then the one at the right
rear.</p>

<p>“We’ve done it!” Judy laughed jubilantly. “We’ve
stopped them!”</p>

<p>“But for how long?” Miss Meadows speculated.
“Don’t move, girls! Keep hidden! Those men are
in an ugly mood.”</p>

<p>The two hi-jackers had leaped from the cab of
the crippled truck. As they beheld the disaster
which had befallen them, a car came up the hill,
pulling alongside. It was the Forest Service automobile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
driven by Lowell Diethelm. By mere inches,
the tires missed the nail-studded rubber mat.</p>

<p>“Now what?” the ranger demanded furiously.
“Can’t you keep going and get out of here?”</p>

<p>“Keep going?” one of the truckers snarled. “On
rims? We’ll have to abandon the cargo.” Diethelm
swung open the door of the coupe. “Get in!” he directed.
“We’ll try to get over the state line.”</p>

<p>The possibility of the two hi-jackers transferring
to the ranger’s car had not occurred to Judy. Now,
convinced that her scheme had failed, she involuntarily
started to leave her hiding place.</p>

<p>Miss Meadows held her back. “No, Judy!” she
warned. “We’ve done all we can! Those men are
dangerous. Let them go.”</p>

<p>“Let them go,” Judy half moaned. “Oh, this is
awful! After stopping that big truck, to fail so miserably!”</p>

<p>“We saved the cargo at any rate,” Kathleen reminded
her. “Furthermore, Diethelm hasn’t driven
off yet! I don’t think he will either!”</p>

<p>The latter excited comment was made as she
saw two Forest Service cars sweep down the main
highway.</p>

<p>Before Lowell Diethelm could pull away, the other
two automobiles had blocked the main highway.</p>

<p>“Our fish are netted now!” Kathleen shouted gleefully.
“Who says your idea failed, Judy? It was a
grand one!”</p>

<p>No longer fearful, the three came out of hiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Six rangers, two of whom the Scouts knew by
sight, had surrounded Lowell Diethelm’s car. They
had their revolvers trained on the two hi-jackers,
but Diethelm was trying to put up a convincing
story.</p>

<p>“I captured these birds red-handed,” he said
glibly. “I was trying to get ’em to headquarters,
when they over-powered me. I’m sure glad you fellows
came along.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?” dryly inquired Ranger Wentz. “Sounds
pretty phoney, Diethelm. You’ll have to think up
a better one than that to tell the chief.”</p>

<p>By this time, Judy, Kathleen and Miss Meadows
had reached the ranger cars. As rapidly as they
could talk, they told the Forest Service men exactly
what had occurred.</p>

<p>“You’re the girl who called over the radio phone,
aren’t you?” one of the rangers asked Judy.</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“She stopped the truck too, by putting nails on
the road,” Kathleen added, very proud of her friend.
“What a ‘welcome’ that mat proved to be for the
hi-jackers!”</p>

<p>Within five minutes, the rangers were reenforced
by state highway patrolmen, who had responded to
an alert. If there had been any previous doubt as
to the identity of the two hi-jackers, it then was
dispelled. State highwaymen definitely identified
Joe Pompilli, and recognized his companion as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Porky Burns, a hi-jacker, who had operated in three
states.</p>

<p>“Five or six drivers work this area,” a ranger told
Judy. “Joe’s the head of the outfit though. We may
never catch the others, but now that we have him,
the gang will fall apart.”</p>

<p>“Joe was pretty reckless to keep working this
territory after he knew he was wanted,” Judy remarked.
“Especially after that truck accident, when
Kathy and I patched him up.”</p>

<p>“Joe operates that way,” the ranger answered.
“He was dead sure of himself. First, he could depend
upon our double-crossing friend, Diethelm,
to tip him off as to road blocks.”</p>

<p>“This private road to the cave must have been
used in emergencies too,” Judy added. “My aunt
saw the truck headlights on one of the nights that
the state highway patrol had put up its road block.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” the ranger agreed, “it’s plain enough that
Diethelm tipped ’em off regularly. That’s probably
why they chanced making one last haul before
they moved to another locality. Pompilli had taken
pains to make himself known as a regular trucker
on the road, especially at Silverton and Grove City
where he was a good spender. He figured only the
state highway patrol could cause him any trouble,
and he took that chance.”</p>

<p>The state patrolmen requested Kathleen and
Judy to accompany them to headquarters to make
sworn statements as to their knowledge of what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
happened. Eager to pin evidence on the two men,
they went willingly. They were questioned at
length, and in turn learned considerably more
about how Joe Pompilli and his gang had operated.</p>

<p>“Without Diethelm’s help, we’d have cleaned
them out weeks ago,” a patrolman told the Scouts.
“He’s made a clean breast of his part in the mess to
the Chief forester.”</p>

<p>“Diethelm has confessed?” Kathleen asked in disbelief.</p>

<p>“Yes, he knew we had him dead to rights anyway.
Matter of fact, he’s rather remorseful, the boys
tell me. Diethelm’s a queer duck. It seems he made
a brilliant record in college and had a fine career
ahead of him as a forest ranger. But on his first
assignment, something went wrong. He ran into
personal trouble with his superior, and was reprimanded.
He couldn’t take it. So he brooded and
figured on a way to get even.”</p>

<p>“Then the help he gave the hi-jackers was to
even an old score with another ranger?” Judy inquired.</p>

<p>“Not entirely. It made him susceptible to suggestion,
shall we say. Diethelm was a weak character.
He wanted easy money. Joe Pompilli offered
it to him, and so he sold himself cheap.”</p>

<p>“Diethelm even accused the girls in our Scout
Camp of being careless with fire,” Kathleen remarked
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that matter came up,” the highway patrolman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
said, reminded of it by her remark. “Diethelm
admitted to the chief ranger that on two occasions
he started small fires as a diversion. He wanted to
keep rangers and patrolmen occupied to give the
hi-jackers a better chance to slide their stolen cargo
through.”</p>

<p>“Then the Scouts can’t be blamed for that fire?”</p>

<p>“No, they’ve been cleared.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a relief!” Kathleen laughed.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing that puzzles me,” Judy said
thoughtfully. “When my aunt first moved into Calico
Cottage, someone telephoned&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I can tell you about that too,” the patrolman
broke in. “Krumm’s cottage stood idle for quite a
spell. Now and then, Diethelm or members of Joe’s
gang would use the telephone. The cottage gave a
clear view of the entrance to the private road. A
couple of times, we think Joe and his truckers spent
a night at the cottage. Naturally, after your aunt
moved in, they had to abandon using it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that explains the ghost!” Kathleen exclaimed.</p>

<p>Judy, however, shook her head. “I’m afraid not,”
she said. “At least I haven’t heard that Joe Pompilli
played a flute. Our ghost is an entirely different
matter.”</p>

<p>By the time the two girls returned to Calico Cottage,
it was well after eleven o’clock. Miss Meadows
anxiously awaited their return. She listened attentively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to their long account of what had happened
in town.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that’s over and we won’t be bothered
by weird lights on the road any more,” she declared
fervently. “If I weren’t so worried about Bart, I
could begin to enjoy my vacation here.”</p>

<p>“Bart?” Judy repeated, startled. The excitement
of the morning had washed all thought of the young
milkman from her mind.</p>

<p>“I took it upon myself to telephone his landlady,”
Miss Meadows went on. “Bart left his room early
yesterday morning, and he’s not been seen since!”</p>

<p>“That might not mean anything serious, Aunt
Mattie.”</p>

<p>“I talked with the other milkman this morning
while you were in town,” Miss Meadows continued.
“He thinks as I do, that Bart went into the cave.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he went down into the cavern before
those hi-jackers parked themselves in the entranceway,”
Kathleen speculated. “Perhaps he didn’t dare
come out until they left. He may be waiting somewhere
in the dark passageway even now.”</p>

<p>“That is a possibility,” agreed Miss Meadows,
instantly becoming more cheerful. She reached for
her hat and jacket. “I’ll go down there now, and let
him know that it’s safe to come out.”</p>

<h2><a name="xxii" id="xxii"></a><i>Chapter 22</i><br />
<span>DESCENT INTO THE CAVE</span></h2>

<p class="noi">JUDY and Kathleen would not allow Miss Meadows
to go alone to Calico Cave.</p>

<p>Insisting upon accompanying her, they made
cheerful talk as they tramped down the now familiar
forest road.</p>

<p>Moving along the narrow path far above the silvery
White River, Judy was the first to see Pete lying
at the mouth of the dark cave.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s still there!” she exclaimed. “Poor doggie,
do you suppose he’s had anything to eat or
drink?”</p>

<p>Pete lay upon his stomach, head between his
paws. A picture of utter dejection, he whined and
whimpered as the girls stooped to pet him.</p>

<p>“Bart must be down in the cave,” Judy declared.
“Otherwise, why would Pete lie here and act as if
he’d lost his last friend?”</p>

<p>The three stepped into the dim interior of the
cave. Judy cupped her hands and shouted Bart’s
name repeatedly.</p>

<p>Her voice echoed weirdly through the cave, but
there was no answering call. If Bart had descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
into the cavern, it was evident that he was at a level
so far below that he could not hear the cry.</p>

<p>“No, Judy,” Miss Meadows said firmly, as her
niece would have started down into the cave. “We
don’t dare explore alone. It’s unsafe.”</p>

<p>“What should we do?” Kathleen asked, pulling
her jacket more tightly about her, for the air was
cool.</p>

<p>“Bart may be safe enough,” Judy added anxiously.
“Then again, if he braved the siphon, there’s
no telling what may have happened.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get in touch with Bart’s landlady again,”
Miss Meadows finally decided. “There’s a chance
he may have gone out of town, and returned to his
room by this time.”</p>

<p>“If he shouldn’t be back&mdash;” Judy began. “Then
what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we can do except to notify the
authorities,” Miss Meadows said, deeply troubled.
“Meanwhile, you girls are to return to camp. I’ll
feed Pete and see if I can coax him to the cottage.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like going back to camp just now,”
Judy said soberly. “Until I know that Bart is safe,
I couldn’t enjoy any of the Scout activities.”</p>

<p>“Neither could I,” chimed in Kathleen. “It’s been
such an exciting day already. I feel sort of jittery
inside.”</p>

<p>The three crawled out of the cave into the sunlight.
Pete scrambled up alertly as they emerged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
but could not be coaxed away from the entranceway.</p>

<p>“If only we dared go down into the cave, we
could learn what became of Bart,” Kathleen remarked
to her companions who stood silent and
uncertain. “Then we could end this dreadful suspense.”</p>

<p>“We can’t go down into the cave without a
guide,” Miss Meadows repeated firmly. “I know of
no one&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Captain Hager!” Judy cried. “He could help us,
if he will!”</p>

<p>“Of course! Why didn’t I think of him? At the
very least, he should be able to advise us. Where
does he live, Judy?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure. I think, in a cabin somewhere
along the river.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose you girls could find him?” Miss
Meadows urged. “I’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>“We can try,” Judy promised.</p>

<p>She and Kathleen set off at once, making their
way to the river level. Captain Hager was not at the
dock where they first had met him, nor was his
boat anywhere visible on the river.</p>

<p>Judy surveyed the water front, noticing a two-room
shack several hundred yards down the beach.</p>

<p>“That might be his place,” she said. “We can try
there anyway.”</p>

<p>A brisk walk brought them to the modest little
cabin. Though small, the building was trim and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
neat, and had recently been whitewashed. There
was a little garden at the rear, carefully watered
and fertilized. An anchor, encrusted with rust, hung
above the door.</p>

<p>“This must be Captain Hager’s place,” Judy decided.</p>

<p>She knocked. After a time, the door opened. Captain
Hager stood there in his shirt sleeves, looking
older and less spry than the girls had remembered
him.</p>

<p>But upon recognizing the Scouts, his face creased
into a welcoming smile.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in!” he boomed.</p>

<p>The room into which he led the girls was extremely
severe and quite bare of furniture. There was a
bunk bed, a stove, an ice box and two wooden
chairs. Above the bed hung the picture of a middle-aged
woman in a heavy gilt frame.</p>

<p>“My wife,” said Captain Hager, noticing Judy’s
eyes upon the picture. “That was all I kept from the
old place. Sold all my furniture at auction. An old
salt like me can’t be bothered with fancy trappings.”</p>

<p>He limped as he walked across the cabin floor
to pull out chairs for the girls.</p>

<p>“Your leg is bothering you?” Judy asked, taking
the seat he offered.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the old rheumatiz come back to fret me,”
Captain Hager sighed. “For the last couple o’ days
I’ve been hobbling around like a cripple.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Judy gazed at Kathleen despairingly, feeling that
it would be useless even to broach the subject of
the call. In seeking Captain Hager as a guide, she
had forgotten that his lively talk and manner belied
his age and infirmities.</p>

<p>“Now what brings you here?” the captain inquired.
“If it’s fishing, I’ll have to say no, because
I’m in dry dock for a couple of days until I get to
feeling better again.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know about your rheumatism,” Judy
said. “I guess it’s quite out of the question.”</p>

<p>“What is?” the old man demanded. “It wasn’t
fishing that brought you .”</p>

<p>Judy shook her head. “It’s Bart,” she told him.
“We think he’s gone into the cave again. He’s been
missing more than a day, and we’re afraid he’s
trapped down there. Either that, or he’s attempted
the siphon.”</p>

<p>Captain Hager did not speak for a long while.
Then he muttered: “The siphon! I told that boy
to wash it out of his mind, but I always knew he’d
try it someday. The thought of it always was a challenge
and a plague to him.”</p>

<p>“What do you think we should do?” Judy asked
desperately. “Notify the authorities?”</p>

<p>“If he’s gone through the siphon, he’s beyond
help,” the old man answered. “There’s no man living
in this community, who would risk his life to
try to force that tunnel of water. Either he’ll get
back on his own, or like his father before him, he’ll
be heard of no more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
“But supposing he didn’t attempt the siphon,”
Kathleen interposed. “Maybe he’s trapped somewhere
below the surface by a fall of rock. Would
the rangers check, do you think?”</p>

<p>“They might make up a search party,” the old
man conceded. “But who would lead it? That cave
is as simple as A-B-C for a skipper that knows the
layout. The rangers have their maps, but what do
they know of Hager’s Hole? Now if I were ten years
younger&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be fair to ask you,” Judy said.
“You’re not feeling well and your rheumatism&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who says I’m not feeling well?” Captain Hager
growled. “Next to good salt air, there’s nothing better
for the ache o’ old bones than cool cave air.”</p>

<p>“You’ll take us down there?” Judy asked eagerly.
“You’re sure it wouldn’t be too hard on you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go as far as the siphon, or until we find Bart,”
the old captain promised.</p>

<p>“How soon can we get started?” Judy urged.</p>

<p>“As soon as I gather some rope, a good light and
a few things we may need. But time’s no matter in
a cave. Night or day, it’s all the same, once you’re
underground.”</p>

<p>“Will we need heavy clothes?” Kathleen asked.</p>

<p>“Those you’re wearing will be all right,” the captain
assured her. “The temperature is the same
everywhere in the cave. Heavy clothing is cumbersome
and burdens one in climbing. You’ll need flashlights
and plenty of extra batteries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
“We’ll get them and meet you at the cave entrance,”
Judy said, starting for the door. She paused,
and then impulsively flung her arms about Captain
Hager’s bulky shoulders.</p>

<p>“None o’ that!” he chuckled, enjoying the embrace.
“Save your pep for the cave. Going down is
easy enough, but it’s a tough climb back.”</p>

<p>The sun was high by the time Captain Hager
rejoined the two girls and Judy’s aunt at the cave
entrance. Meanwhile, Miss Meadows had confirmed
by a telephone call, that Bart had not returned to
his rooming house.</p>

<p>After considerable discussion, it was decided that
only Captain Hager and the two girls should make
the descent into the cave. Though reluctant to see
the three go without her, Miss Meadows shuddered
at the thought of exploring the unknown. Captain
Hager relieved her mind by assuring her that with
him the girls would not be in the slightest danger.</p>

<p>“You’ll be more help to us here, Ma’am,” he told
Miss Meadows. “If everything goes well, we should
be back within four hours, unless we’re lucky
enough to run into Bart before that. Who knows?
The young scamp may be day dreaming down
there in a sacred grotto. Sometimes, the beauty of
the formations is so overpowering, it makes a lubber
forget time and space and the cares o’ the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t forget to come back as quickly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
you can,” Miss Meadows warned. “I’ll be dreadfully
worried until you’re back here with Bart.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best to find him,” Captain Hager
said soberly. “I love that boy like my own son.”</p>

<p>“I know you do, and that you’re exerting yourself
to go down into the cave,” Miss Meadows replied.
“If you’re not back in four hours, I’ll notify the
ranger station.”</p>

<p>“Make it five hours,” Captain Hager corrected.
“I’m a mite slower than I was in my younger days.
But if my ticker holds out, I’ll be back here in fine
shape. Ready, maties?”</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>“Then follow me,” directed the captain. “Walk
close behind and be careful about dislodging rocks.”</p>

<p>Single file, the three entered the cave, its ragged
shadows enveloping them.</p>

<p>As they paused an instant, the beams of their
flashlights picked up the lovely emerald green tint
of roof moss. Then silently, they began the descent
into the cavern and loneliness closed in.</p>

<h2><a name="xxiii" id="xxiii"></a><i>Chapter 23</i><br />
<span>THE SIPHON</span></h2>

<p class="noi">THE descent to the chamber of the White Witch
was quickly made. There, the party of three paused
briefly to catch breath and to view again the weird
figure which captured the imagination.</p>

<p>A tunnel, at times narrow and low, wound deeper
and deeper into the earth. Judy and Kathleen kept
close to their guide. In the stillness of the cavern
they could hear his somewhat labored breathing,
for even the slightest sound was magnified.</p>

<p>They came presently to another small chamber
where they paused, speechless. Stalactites sparkled
like jewels, standing out in the most fantastic
shapes.</p>

<p>Judy could imagine animal figures, all in a variety
of color, milky white, red, green and black. The
colors, Captain Hager explained, came from mineral
infiltration.</p>

<p>“No wonder Bart couldn’t resist this cave,” Judy
remarked in awe, entranced. “It’s like a fairyland!
How I wish all the Scouts could see it!”</p>

<p>In close formation, the three went on into the
cavern depths. A cooler wind met them, but from
where it arose they gained no clue.</p>

<p>The going had become harder now, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
edging through a narrow space, the three stopped
for a moment beside a translucent column which
rose from the floor to the roof.</p>

<p>As they stood thus, there came a deafening crash
behind them.</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen froze in their tracks, too terrified
to utter a sound.</p>

<p>“A cave-in behind us?” Kathleen finally asked in
a choked whisper.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” the captain reassured her.
“Sounded like a blast of dynamite far away. Like
enough the rangers are blasting a tree stump somewhere
in the park area.”</p>

<p>“But it sounded as if the cave roof had fallen!”
Judy said, still shaken.</p>

<p>“All sounds underground are magnified,” Captain
Hager explained. “Even the dripping of water
can be very loud. Off to the right there is a Talking
Grotto. But we will not explore that passage, for
Bart would not waste time there.”</p>

<p>To proceed, it was necessary to creep across a
slippery formation which resembled a frozen waterfall.
They passed through a room which was cluttered
with grotesque toadstool types of stalagmites,
and then came to formations so delicate that they
appeared as a lacy cobweb.</p>

<p>As they sat down to rest their legs for a moment,
Captain Hager told the girls that the beautiful pillars
they had seen farther back were made by the
joining of stalactites and stalagmites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
The growth of formations, he added, was much
faster than generally believed. Varying rainfall, the
thickness of the rock penetrated by water, and the
rate of drip, all affected the deposits, he explained.</p>

<p>“All water that goes into a cave, must come out
somewhere,” the captain continued. “During a hard
rain storm, this cave could be dangerous at the
lower levels.”</p>

<p>“You mean we’d get the rain down here?” Kathleen
questioned in amazement.</p>

<p>“Belatedly, yes. Shortly now, you’ll see the underground
river. During the dry months it shrivels, but
in the rainy season, it thunders through the chasms
like a mad demon.”</p>

<p>“I hope it doesn’t storm today,” Kathleen said
nervously.</p>

<p>“The day was clear,” Captain Hager reassured
her. “And there has been no recent rain to flood the
underground stream.”</p>

<p>Farther on, the girls came to a series of small
pools in which there were blind fish. They did not
tarry long, but continued through another long, narrow
passage.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Bart came this way?” Judy finally
asked. “Couldn’t he have taken any number of
branch-offs?”</p>

<p>“The branch-offs are dead-end streets, so to
speak,” replied the captain. “If I know that lad,
we’ll find him at the siphon, or we’ll not find him
this voyage. Tired?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
“My legs feel sort of cramped,” Judy confessed,
ashamed of her weariness. “But I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“We’re nearing the end,” the captain encouraged
the girls. “The last few yards are the hardest. Then
we’ll bring up at the siphon.”</p>

<p>“And if Bart isn’t there?” asked Judy.</p>

<p>The old captain did not answer. He gazed
thoughtfully at his sturdy boots, tested his light
briefly on the limestone wall, and then signaled that
he was ready to resume the descent.</p>

<p>Not far beyond the point where they had rested,
the three explorers came to a chamber so large that
it seemed to have no surrounding walls.</p>

<p>At its entrance, Captain Hager hesitated, seemingly
reluctant to go on.</p>

<p>“If we continue to the siphon, we must cross
this chamber, with no wall to guide us,” he explained.
“Beyond, in the darkness, there is a single
narrow passageway leading on. If we hit the target,
we’ll soon be at the end of the cave. If we miss, we
may spend hours, trying to grope our way. We’ll be
like a ship wallowing without chart or compass. Unless
you have plenty of nerve&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We have,” Judy said resolutely. “We’ve come so
far now, we can’t turn back without learning whether
or not Bart is in the cave.”</p>

<p>“Aye, I figured you’d say that,” Captain Hager
replied.</p>

<p>He then uncoiled a length of nylon rope, tying it
first about his own waist, then around Kathleen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and finally about Judy, who would bring up the
rear.</p>

<p>“We must keep close together,” he warned. “If
we do, there is no danger. Even if we miss the passageway
on the first try, we will find it. Full steam
ahead, my hearties!”</p>

<p>For a few feet the girls followed along a rough,
jagged wall before moving slowly out into the vast
room. The silence and immensity of the cavern
were momentarily terrifying, for Captain Hager’s
light revealed only a dark void ahead.</p>

<p>By supreme effort Judy and Kathleen held their
nerves in rigid check. Each step seemed to be taking
them deeper and deeper into oblivion. A dozen
doubts assailed them. Would Captain Hager ever
find the narrow passage leading out of the chamber?
And if they should be successful in reaching
the siphon, would not the return be even more
difficult?</p>

<p>The darkness seemed endless, but finally Captain
Hager’s light revealed a rough wall ahead. A
wave of relief washed over Judy and Kathleen. But
it was short lived.</p>

<p>Their guide had paused to move the flash beam
slowly along the solid wall, first to the right, then
to the left. He muttered something, but his words
were indistinguishable.</p>

<p>“Are&mdash;are we lost?” Kathleen asked.</p>

<p>The captain deliberately did not answer. After a
moment, he started on again, groping along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
wall. Kathleen did not repeat her question.</p>

<p>For awhile Captain Hager kept on, the girls directly
behind, following blindly. Then suddenly the
old man seemed to relax, and they heard him give
a throaty chuckle.</p>

<p>“Hear that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen already had distinguished the
distant sound of running water. The underground
stream!</p>

<p>At the same instant that they heard the splash of
water, Captain Hager’s flash beam focused upon
the narrow opening in the cavern wall&mdash;the passageway
for which he had searched.</p>

<p>“We near the end,” he said simply.</p>

<p>They moved quickly through the narrow corridor.
The thunder of a distant waterfall they never were
to see, was louder now in their ears.</p>

<p>The floor of the passageway sloped sharply downward.
Kathleen slipped but did not fall, for Judy
caught her arm to give her support.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the corridor turned, and the girls saw
water ahead. The underground stream, quiet and
dark, emerged from a wall of rock to flow tranquilly
beneath the slightly arched cave-roof above.</p>

<p>Captain Hager halted. “We’ve come to the end,”
he announced.</p>

<p>Judy and Kathleen were stunned. “The end,”
Judy repeated, scarcely comprehending. “But I
thought&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We can proceed no further without wading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
along the river bed,” the captain explained. “The
water gradually deepens until it rises to the ceiling.
At that point, one must dive through and swim
underwater, or turn back.”</p>

<p>He focused his light to the right, and the girls
saw the meeting place of wall and water.</p>

<p>“The siphon?” Judy asked.</p>

<p>“Aye, how far it goes, no man knows. It may extend
for only a few feet or yards. Then again, it
may run on indefinitely, with nary a pocket of air.”</p>

<p>“Bart&mdash;?” Judy hesitated to ask the question that
was foremost in her mind.</p>

<p>“Surely he wouldn’t be crazy enough to try to
swim through the siphon!” Kathleen exclaimed.</p>

<p>“The lad is a true spelunker, like his father. He
has the courage of a lion, and the muscles of a
young bear. Since he was a mere boy, he’s studied
and dreamed about this cave.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve seen no evidence that he’s anywhere
in the cavern,” Judy said hopefully.</p>

<p>“No evidence?” Captain Hager’s voice was
muted, as his light came to focus upon a rock shelf
a few feet above the river bed.</p>

<p>For a moment, neither Judy nor Kathleen understood.</p>

<p>Then, they fully comprehended. There on the
rock ledge, set heel to heel, was an empty pair of
shoes. Beside them, in a neat roll, was Bart’s shirt
and jacket.</p>

<h2><a name="xxiv" id="xxiv"></a><i>Chapter 24</i><br />
<span>HELP FROM CAPTAIN HAGER</span></h2>

<p class="noi">THREE hours now had elapsed since Captain
Hager, Judy and Kathleen had ascertained that
Bart Ranieau was somewhere deep in the cave, beyond
the siphon.</p>

<p>Unable to penetrate farther, the three had made
the arduous climb back to the cavern entrance
where Miss Meadows anxiously awaited them.</p>

<p>Their report had been a discouraging one. Without
question, Bart was somewhere in Calico Cave,
but whether or not alive, no one could say.</p>

<p>“The lad may have reached an air pocket, or a
chamber,” Captain Hager said. “That’s what he
gambled on.”</p>

<p>“He’s been missing a day and a half now,” Miss
Meadows reminded the seaman. “While you were
down in the cave, I checked on that point. Surely,
if he’s ever coming back, he’d have made it by
now.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” the captain soberly agreed.</p>

<p>“Can’t something be done?” Miss Meadows
urged.</p>

<p>“Not a man in these parts would risk that siphon,
ma’am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
“I realize that,” Miss Meadows answered. “But
is there no other way to reach him, if he’s still alive?
Couldn’t the rangers blast the rock perhaps?”</p>

<p>“It would be impractical and dangerous, Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“But the cave must have an exit somewhere close&mdash;if
only it could be traced down! If one could approach
the siphon from the other direction&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aye, Ma’am,” Captain Hager replied, “I’ve been
pondering on it&mdash;pondering hard.”</p>

<p>“Then you do have an idea!” Judy cried. “Does it
have anything to do with Calico Cottage?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been meditatin’ along that line,” the old
man admitted.</p>

<p>“Is there any chance the cave connects in some
way with the foundation of the cottage?” Judy demanded
excitedly. “Remember, all those strange
sounds which seemed to come from the basement!
They might have been cave noises! And we noticed
a gust of cool air coming through a crack in the
mortar.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” the captain nodded. “Bart and I discussed
it many a time. Those strange sounds that have
scared the living daylights out of cottage tenants
come from the cave right enough.”</p>

<p>“Then there must be a passageway close to the
foundation wall!” Judy cried.</p>

<p>“I tried to convince Krumm he should build on
a new foundation, but he wouldn’t take advice.”</p>

<p>“If that old foundation could be torn down, maybe
an opening down into the cave could be found!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Judy went on. “What do you think, Captain
Hager?”</p>

<p>“It’s our only chance to ever learn what became
of Bart.”</p>

<p>“Then why are we waiting?” Miss Meadows demanded.
“We must put men to work at once!”</p>

<p>“Krumm will have to give his permission,” Captain
Hager said, deeply troubled. “It will mean
wrecking the foundation of the cottage.”</p>

<p>“But a young man’s life is at stake!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” the captain agreed, “Krumm should consent,
if there’s a mite o’ humanity in him. We’ll go
now and put it up to him.”</p>

<p>Word had spread through the village of Bart
Ranieau’s plight and everyone, it seemed, was discussing
the young man’s fate. Even before the little
party arrived at Mr. Krumm’s real estate office,
groups of curious began to congregate at the cave
entranceway.</p>

<p>Forest rangers and state highwaymen roped off
the private road leading to the cavern, and set up
guards to prevent persons from trying to explore.
Miss Ward, bringing her girls to Calico Cottage,
learned belatedly of the disaster and what was being
done to try to find Bart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Hager was using all his powers
of persuasion upon Mr. Krumm. The real estate
man, reluctant to have his property damaged, argued
that it would be a useless expenditure to
tear down the old foundation wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
“Like as not we wouldn’t find the cave exit,” he
protested. “Even if we did, there’s not much chance
of finding that foolhardy young man alive and you
know it! He went the way his father did before him,
drowned in the siphon!”</p>

<p>“We don’t know it,” Captain Hager retorted.
“There’s air somewhere close by to that siphon.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because time and again Bart found tadpoles.”</p>

<p>“What have they got to do with it?” Mr. Krumm
demanded.</p>

<p>“Tadpoles are a sure sign of open air being near.
They’re creatures that never venture far into underground
waters.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“I figure there must be a brook somewhere close
where the underground river empties.”</p>

<p>“There’s no brook around the cottage, and no water
under it either.”</p>

<p>“I’m not concerned where the river empties,”
Captain Hager said. “I do think the cottage wall
connects in some way with a passage down into the
cave. Where it would lead, if we get into it, no man
knows.”</p>

<p>“You want me to tear down the foundation on a
wild chance like that?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do it,” Captain Hager said grimly.
He moved in close. “Either you do it like a gentleman
and get credit for being a hero, or I’ll have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
law on you! You can’t abandon that boy to save a
dollar!”</p>

<p>Mr. Krumm’s eyes snapped angrily. Judy and
Kathleen were certain he would order them all out
of the real estate office.</p>

<p>But suddenly, his opposition dissolved.</p>

<p>“Okay, tear down the foundation!” he consented.
“Get on with it!”</p>

<p>Once Mr. Krumm had waived his objection, men
from the village, directed by forest rangers, immediately
went to work.</p>

<p>Judy, Kathleen and the other Scouts milled about
the cottage, watching as a small section of the foundation
was torn apart. As the throng increased, only
Miss Meadows, Miss Ward and the Scouts were
permitted in the building.</p>

<p>Dust from the bricks and mortar kept the girls
out of the cellar much of the time. But as the day
wore on, a shout from below, brought them scrambling
down the stairway.</p>

<p>By this time, one section of wall had been torn
away, though the main supports of the cottage remained.
The musty odor which had annoyed occupants
of Calico Cottage now was very strong and
definitely came from the jagged opening. A group
of workmen clustered about the hole, blocking
Judy’s view.</p>

<p>“Have you found the cave opening?” she cried.
“Have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
“Aye,” Captain Hager informed her jovially. “But
where the passage leads, we don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What causes the odor?” Kathleen asked, sniffing.</p>

<p>“Imprisoned air. It’s gradually clearing out. Like
as not it comes from decaying vegetation&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Judy tensely.</p>

<p>“The boy with the flute!” exclaimed Kathleen in
awe.</p>

<p>Those in the room had frozen to attention. From
the great gaping hole there issued forth a musical
note, for all the world like the music of a flute.</p>

<p>Then there came a series of taps as if someone
might be thumping a stick on hard rock.</p>

<p>“That’s a man-made sound!” cried Captain
Hager. “Bart’s down there! He’s trying to signal
us!”</p>

<p>“We’ll get him out!” shouted a forest ranger. “Any
volunteers to go down into the hole?”</p>

<p>Arthur Wentz stepped forward. Rope was tied
about his waist, and carefully he was lowered until
his feet touched solid flooring.</p>

<p>For awhile those above could see the descending
light, then it vanished. They paid out more and
more rope until the coil was nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>Finally, a signal came&mdash;two short tugs. Gently,
the men began to pull on the rope.</p>

<p>“Wentz is coming up!” one of the workmen
shouted. “It’s hard pulling!”</p>

<p>“Then he must have found Bart!” Judy cried,
hugging Kathleen in her excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Minutes passed as the men kept at the rope. Then
from the hole staggered Wentz and the young man
he supported.</p>

<p>Bart was barefoot and his bare back had been
covered by the ranger’s shirt. His lips were blue
with cold, but he grinned with the spirit of a conqueror.</p>

<p>“Captain Hager!” he mumbled, embracing the
old man. “I did it!”</p>

<p>“You sure did, son,” the captain answered, tears
streaming down his grimy cheeks. “You almost did
for yourself too.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d get me out,” Bart said. “I never
gave up, never for a minute.”</p>

<p>“You can thank these Scouts,” Captain Hager
said, smiling at Judy and Kathleen. “They pestered
me to go down into the cave with ’em. If they
hadn’t, we’d never have learned that you went
through the siphon.”</p>

<p>“It was a wonderful but terrifying experience,”
Bart mumbled. “My father&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That can wait,” Captain Hager said gruffly.
“You can tell us all about it later. Get yourself to a
warm bed now, before you die of pneumonia. Get
along with ye!”</p>

<p>Nearly exhausted, and shaking with cold, Bart
was lifted bodily and carried to a waiting ambulance.</p>

<h2><a name="xxv" id="xxv"></a><i>Chapter 25</i><br />
<span>COURT OF HONOR</span></h2>

<p class="noi">TWO days had elapsed since Bart Ranieau had
been brought out of Calico Cave suffering from
shock, but otherwise unharmed by his thrilling explorations.</p>

<p>Long hours of sleep and plenty of food had restored
him to his former peak of health. But as his
strength returned, he became restless and pestered
hospital officials until at last they dismissed him.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, Bart sought Judy and Kathleen
at Pine Cone Camp to thank them for saving
his life.</p>

<p>Word spread like wildfire that the young explorer
had arrived and soon the daring young man was
surrounded by Girl Scouts who teased him to tell
the story of his adventure.</p>

<p>“Start at the very beginning,” Judy urged. “Don’t
leave out anything.”</p>

<p>“That’s a large order, but I’ll try,” grinned Bart.
“Well, I’d made up my mind to try the siphon. I
didn’t tell anyone, because I knew if I did, the
authorities would try to stop me.”</p>

<p>“I left my shoes and shirt on the ledge because I
couldn’t be burdened with them in swimming. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
reasoned too, that if I got through, wet clothes
wouldn’t help keep me warm. So I stripped to my
trunks.”</p>

<p>“How long was the siphon?” inquired Betty
Bache, who had joined the group of intent listeners.</p>

<p>“Long enough,” Bart said grimly. “The first one
wasn’t so bad.”</p>

<p>“Then there was more than one?” inquired Ardeth
Packett.</p>

<p>“Two of them. I waded at first. The water finally
came up to my neck and then over my nose. When
I couldn’t walk, I dived.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you scared to death?” Virginia Cunningham
asked with a shiver.</p>

<p>“I sure was,” Bart admitted. “I knew I might find
water to the ceiling for an indefinite distance ahead.
Anyway, I decided to chance it. I took a great deep
breath and plunged through.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” questioned Beverly Chester
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“The first barrier was astonishingly easy. I was
through it in less than a minute and was able to
wade again. My only light was a container of
matches carried in the top of my bathing cap.
Ahead I could see another siphon.”</p>

<p>“You were reckless to go on,” Kathleen chided.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Bart acknowledged, “but it would have
been very nearly as hard to have gone back. I
hoped I’d find where the cave came out.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about the second siphon,” Judy urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
“It was a tricky one, I’m here to report. I don’t
know how long I was underwater, but it seemed a
minute and a half. My lungs were bursting when
finally I emerged. But it was worth it!”</p>

<p>“What did you find?” demanded Beverly.</p>

<p>“A hall filled with the most beautiful formations
I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Better than the White Witch and those chambers
before one gets to the siphon?” Judy asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, a thousand times better! I stood there
speechless and in awe, dazzled by the glitter of so
much crystal. For a little while, I lost all count of
time. It seemed unreal.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” Kathleen urged, as Bart became lost in
his own memories.</p>

<p>“Those stalactites and stalagmites were fantastic beyond
description,” Bart told the Scouts. “There
were animal shapes, and statue-like figures&mdash;one a
woman with a bridal veil. Why, if steps can be
built down from Calico Cottage, everyone can see
the chamber! Krumm will make more money opening
up the cave than he ever could do renting the
cottage.”</p>

<p>“While you were down there, you didn’t solve
the mystery of Calico Cave’s ghost, did you?” Judy
asked. “You didn’t meet our little boy with the
flute?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did,” Bart replied. “The explanation
for those flute noises is simplicity itself. One of the
roof formations takes the shape of a long hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
tube. Each time water drops through the tube onto
the floor, it produces the musical note.”</p>

<p>“Did you realize how close you were to the basement
of Calico Cottage?” Judy next asked the young
explorer.</p>

<p>“I thought I might be somewhere near, but I
couldn’t be sure. One loses all sense of direction
under ground. I tried to climb, but the rocks were
straight up, and I couldn’t get a grip.”</p>

<p>“When you first came out of the cave, you spoke
of your father,” Kathleen said, rather reluctant to
remind Bart of a painful subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know now what became of him,” he answered.
“My father didn’t drown as we thought. He
made both of the siphons just as I did.”</p>

<p>“Then he was trapped in the chamber and unable
to signal anyone.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if he tried or had the strength to
signal,” Bart responded. “I found the skeleton and
a note, only part of which I’ve been able to read.
My dad had a heart attack. He wasn’t too expert as
a swimmer, and the exertion together with the excitement
of his discovery, may have brought on a
sudden attack. It must have taken him fast.”</p>

<p>“But there was no escape from the chamber?”
Virginia probed. “No way back?”</p>

<p>“Of that I’m not sure either,” Bart returned. “It
would take a hardy swimmer to swim against the
current. I think I might have made it. I was turning
the thought over, trying to decide what to do. I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
about made up my mind that if no help came, I’d
attempt it before my strength left me.”</p>

<p>“Does the cave have no exit except through the
cottage foundation?” Ardeth next interposed a question.
“What becomes of the underground river?”</p>

<p>“It empties into the brook which flows into the
river,” Bart explained. “But no one can follow the
course of the underground stream farther than I
went. The way beyond is barred by solid rock.”</p>

<p>The young explorer spent more than an hour at
camp, telling the Scouts many interesting facts
about caves in general.</p>

<p>All the girls were envious of Judy and Kathleen
because they had viewed so many of the beautiful
formations.</p>

<p>“The most breath-taking sights are in the chamber
directly under Calico Cave,” Bart said. “There’s
no reason why a ladder or steps can’t be built down
there, so everyone can view them. I am to talk to
Mr. Krumm today and see what can be done. It’s a
cinch he can’t rent his cottage without extensive repairs,
and it would pay him to open up the cave instead.”</p>

<p>Since the tearing down of the cottage foundation
wall, Miss Meadows had not been able to stay in
the dwelling. She had taken a room at the hotel for
one night, and after that Mr. Krumm had transferred
her to another one of his cottages, directly
on Morning Glory Lake.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the real estate man had announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
that Miss Meadows might have the place rent free.</p>

<p>“You’ve had a rugged time of it at the other cottage,”
he acknowledged. “You deserve a couple
of peaceful weeks.”</p>

<p>The girls correctly surmised that Mr. Krumm’s
generosity was occasioned by a belated realization
that Calico Cave had great commercial possibilities.</p>

<p>They were entirely right. In the week that followed,
the real estate man bolstered up the cottage
foundation again, converting the building into an
office where admission tickets could be sold.</p>

<p>He then had carpenters construct a stairway
down to the fairyland chamber, one which would
serve temporarily until a more permanent installation
could be made.</p>

<p>Sometime prior to the day on which the public
was to given its first view of the cave, Mr. Krumm
visited Pine Cone Camp to present a check to Judy.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” she asked in astonishment.
“Is it a contribution for the Girl Scouts?”</p>

<p>“You may consider it as such as you want to,” he
said. “It’s your bonus for solving the mystery of the
Calico Cottage ghost.”</p>

<p>“That was easy because I had scientific helpers,”
Judy laughed. “I think Bart and Captain Hager deserve
the money even more than do the Scouts.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” Mr. Krumm said a bit
grimly. “They’ll have a share of the profits from the
cave operation. Bart saw to that. He convinced me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
that I couldn’t manage the place without them
around to look after things.”</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll accept the check,” Judy decided.
“Not for myself though. I’ll give it to Pine
Cone Camp. Perhaps the money can be used to
bring some girl to camp who otherwise couldn’t
afford to come.”</p>

<p>Before departing, Mr. Krumm invited all the
Scouts to a preview of the cave chamber.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t it be fun if we could have our
Court of Awards ceremony there!” Judy exclaimed.
“Could we, Mr. Krumm?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right with me,” he said. “The electric
lights will be in by the end of the week.”</p>

<p>Judy spoke at once to the camp director about
her plan. At first, Miss Lubell was somewhat hesitant,
but after personally inspecting the cave room
and the facilities which had been provided for the
public, she became as enthusiastic as Judy over
the prospect of holding a ceremony in the fairyland
chamber.</p>

<p>The night set for the affair finally arrived. The
Scouts enjoyed a picnic supper at the cottage
grounds, after hiking to the site. Afterwards, with
Bart and Captain Hager acting as guides, they descended
to the underground chamber.</p>

<p>Electric lights, skillfully placed, gave the colorful
formations ethereal effects which were quite breathtaking.
The Scouts named many of the figures, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
them such titles as the Indian Oven, Woman
with a Hood, the Cathedral, and Phantom Hands.</p>

<p>The spell of enchantment was still upon the girls
as they took formation for the Court of Awards
ceremony.</p>

<p>Miss Lubell personally presented special achievement
badges to all the Scouts who had earned them.
Judy, Kathleen, Ardeth, Virginia, and the other
members of Beaver Patrol won honors in many
fields, for dramatics, in swimming, health and for
safety achievements.</p>

<p>Then Miss Lubell announced that for Judy and
Kathleen, there was to be a special award. An expectant
hush fell upon the group.</p>

<p>Amazed and rather embarrassed to be singled out
for particular attention, the two Beaver Patrol girls
stepped forward to receive the badges.</p>

<p>As Miss Lubell held them up, everyone burst into
laughter. As a joke, the Scouts of Lone Tree had
fashioned two huge medals of tin. On their face, in
large letters, they had painted: “Explorer.”</p>

<p>“Just a little memento of your exciting summer,
Judy,” Ardeth assured her. “You know, wherever
you go, you seem to stir up fun and adventure.”</p>

<p>“All of the Scouts do,” Judy corrected. “Kathleen
certainly did as much as I to earn her tin
medal!”</p>

<p>“I just followed in your footsteps,” Kathleen
laughed. “Anyway, we shouldn’t get the credit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
producing forest fires or hi-jackers. Caves are our
specialty.”</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping you find more and better ones,”
Ardeth chuckled, fastening the huge tin medal to
Judy’s Scout uniform. “Or is that possible?”</p>

<p>“We never could discover a more thrilling cave
than Calico,” Judy replied earnestly.</p>

<p>“But you’ll try!” Ardeth teased.</p>

<p>Judy shook her head. Her eyes twinkled as she
answered, “No, I promise you I’ve had enough of
stalagmites and stalactites for one summer. From
this hour forward, I’m spending all my idle hours
at Pine Cone Camp!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
